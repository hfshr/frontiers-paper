abstract = {Variations in definitions and methodologies have created differences in the results and conclusions obtained from studies of football (soccer) injuries, making interstudy comparisons difficult. Therefore an Injury Consensus Group was established under the auspices of F{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}ration Internationale de Football Association Medical Assessment and Research Centre. A nominal group consensus model approach was used. A working document on definitions, methodology, and implementation was discussed by the group. Iterative draft statements were prepared and circulated to members of the group for comment before the final consensus statement was produced. Definitions of injury, recurrent injury, severity, and training and match exposures in football together with criteria for classifying injuries in terms of location, type, diagnosis, and causation are proposed. Proforma for recording players' baseline information, injuries, and training and match exposures are presented. Recommendations are made on how the incidence of match and training injuries should be reported and a checklist of issues and information that should be included in published reports of studies of football injuries is presented.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding the healthy influence of sporting activities on risk factors, in particular those of cardiovascular disease, it is becoming increasingly apparent that sports can present a danger to health in the form of sports injuries. The extent of the sports injury problem calls for preventative action based on the results of epidemiological research. For the interpretation of these facts uniform definitions are needed and limitations of research designs should be known. Measures to prevent sports injuries form part of what is called the 'sequence of prevention'. Firstly the extent of the sports injury problem must be identified and described. Secondly the factors and mechanisms which play a part in the occurrence of sports injuries have to be identified. The third step is to introduce measures that are likely to reduce the future risk and/or severity of sports injuries. This measure should be based on the aetiological factors and the mechanism as identified in the second step. Finally the effect of the measures must be evaluated by repeating the first step. In this review some aspects of the first and second step of the sequence of prevention are discussed. The extent of the sports injury problem is often described by injury incidence and by indicators of the severity of sports injuries. Sports injury incidence should preferably be expressed as the number of sports injuries per exposure time (e.g. per 1000 hours of sports participation) in order to facilitate the comparability of research results. However, one should realise that the outcome of research applying this definition of sports injury incidence is highly dependent on the definitions of 'sports injury' and 'sports participation'. The outcome of such research also depends on the applied research design and research methodology. The incidence of sports injuries depends on: the method used to count injuries (e.g. prospective vs retrospective); the method used to establish the population at risk; and on the representativeness of the sample. Severity of sports injuries can be described on the basis of 6 criteria: the nature of the sports injury; the duration and nature of treatment; sporting time lost; working time lost; permanent damage; and cost. Here also uniform definitions are important and necessary in order to enhance the comparability of research data. In the second step of the 'sequence of prevention' the aetiological factors that play a role in the occurrence of a sports injury have to be identified by epidemiological studies. Epidemiological research on the aetiology of sports injuries requires a conceptual model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {We report the development and validation of a questionnaire measure of the revised reinforcement sensitivity theory (rRST) of personality. Starting with qualitative responses to defensive and approach scenarios modeled on typical rodent ethoexperimental situations, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) revealed a robust 6-factor structure: 2 unitary defensive factors, fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS; related to fear) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS; related to anxiety); and 4 behavioral approach system (BAS) factors (Reward Interest, Goal-Drive Persistence, Reward Reactivity, and Impulsivity). Theoretically motivated thematic facets were employed to sample the breadth of defensive space, comprising FFFS (Flight, Freeze, and Active Avoidance) and BIS (Motor Planning Interruption, Worry, Obsessive Thoughts, and Behavioral Disengagement). Based on theoretical considerations, and statistically confirmed, a separate scale for Defensive Fight was developed. Validation evidence for the 6-factor structure came from convergent and discriminant validity shown by correlations with existing personality scales. We offer the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality Questionnaire to facilitate future research specifically on rRST and, more broadly, on approach-avoidance theories of personality.

abstract = {Sports science research is traditionally monodisciplinary despite calls for an interdisciplinary focus. The primary purpose of this systematic review was to identify studies on talent identification, talent selection and competition performance to determine whether interdisciplinary research is being conducted. Thirty-six studies met the selection criteria. These studies were critiqued relative to sport, skill level, sport science sub-disciplines included, and whether the research was multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary. The secondary purpose of the review was to critique the level of analysis and level of representative task design in performance tests used in the studies. Twenty-five studies were categorised as interdisciplinary, with 11 categorised as multidisciplinary. Thirteen sports were represented with soccer the most frequent followed by field hockey, Australian Rules football, handball and rugby league. Thirty-two studies completed their analysis at a group level and four at an individual level. A total of 337 performance tests were rated for representative task design with 64 categorised as low, 123 as medium and 150 as high. The results pertaining to interdisciplinary studies and individual analyses are discussed in relation to constraints theory, which predicts that interacting variables can explain sport performance. Sports science research is beginning to fulfil the call for interdisciplinary research. Future research, however, needs to consider individual analyses and representative task design of tests to progress sports science knowledge.},

abstract = {Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reasonto reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty.The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series},

abstract = {Missing data in medical research is a common problem that has long been recognised by statisticians and medical researchers alike. In general, if the effect of missing data is not taken into account the results of the statistical analyses will be biased and the amount of variability in the data will not be correctly estimated. There are three main types of missing data pattern: Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR) and Not Missing At Random (NMAR). The type of missing data that a researcher has in their dataset determines the appropriate method to use in handling the missing data before a formal statistical analysis begins. The aim of this practice note is to describe these patterns of missing data and how they can occur, as well describing the methods of handling them. Simple and more complex methods are described, including the advantages and disadvantages of each method as well as their availability in routine software. It is good practice to perform a sensitivity analysis employing different missing data techniques in order to assess the robustness of the conclusions drawn from each approach},

abstract = {Easterbrook's (1959) cue-utilization theory has been widely used to explain the inverted U-shaped relationship, initially established by Yerkes and Dodson, between emotional arousal and performance. The basic tenet of the theory assumes that high levels of arousal lead to restriction of the amount of information to which agents can pay attention. One fundamental derivative of the theory, as typically conceived in psychology, is the assumption that restriction of information or the ability to process a smaller set of data is fundamentally disadvantageous. To explore the merits of this point, we first argue that the relationship depicted by this collapsed version of the Yerkes–Dodson law is far too simplistic to account for the complex relationship between various cognitive functions and emotional arousal. Second, conceptualization of arousal as a unidimen- sional construct needs to be rejected. Finally, and most importantly, we challenge the notion that having more information available is necessarily preferable to having less information.},

abstract = {Traditionally, balance training has been used as part of the rehabilitation programme for ankle injuries. More recently, balance training has been adopted to try and prevent injuries to the ankle and knee joints during sport. The purpose of this review is to synthesise current knowledge in the area of balance ability, training and injury risk, highlight the findings and identify any future research needs. A number of studies have found that poor balance ability is significantly related to an increased risk of ankle injuries in different activities. This relationship appears to be more common in males than females. Multifaceted intervention studies that have included balance training along with jumping, landing and agility exercises have resulted in a significant decrease in ankle or knee injuries in team handball, volleyball and recreational athletes. It is unknown which component of the multifaceted intervention was most effective and whether the effects are additive. As a single intervention, balance training has been shown to significantly reduce the recurrence of ankle ligament injuries in soccer, volleyball and recreational athletes; however, it has not been clearly shown to reduce ankle injuries in athletes without a prior ankle injury. Balance training on its own has also been shown to significantly reduce anterior cruciate ligament injuries in male soccer players. Surprisingly, it was also found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of major knee injuries in female soccer players and overuse knee injuries in male and female volleyball players. The studies with the contrasting findings differed in aspects of their balance training programmes. It would appear that balance training, as a single intervention, is not as effective as when it is part of a multifaceted intervention. Research is required to determine the relative contribution of balance training to a multifaceted intervention so as to generate an effective and efficient preventative programme that can be adopted by athletes of most levels.},

Experimental evidence for an associ- ation between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of either increased sympathetic or reduced vagal activity has encouraged the development of quantitative markers of autonomic activity. Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising such markers. The apparently easy derivation of this measure has popularized its use. As many commercial devices now provide automated measurement of HRV, the cardiologist has been pro- vided with a seemingly simple tool for both research and clinical studies[5]. However, the significance and meaning of the many different measures of HRV are more complex than generally appreciated and there is a potential for incorrect conclusions and for excessive or unfounded extrapolations.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

abstract = {A number of instrumented and non-instrumented measures are used to detect balance deficits associated with functional ankle instability (FAI). Determining outcome measures that detect balance deficits associated with FAI might assist clinicians in identifying impairments that may otherwise go undetected with less responsive balance measures. Thus, our objective was to determine the balance measure that best predicted ankle group membership (FAI or stable ankle). Participants included 17 subjects without a history of ankle sprains (168±9cm, 66±14kg, 24±5 yr) and 17 subjects with FAI (172±9cm, 71±11kg, 22±3 yr). Balance trials were performed without vision and subjects stood on a single leg as motionless as possible for 20s. Balance was quantified with center-of-pressure measures (velocity, area) and error score. Measures were positively correlated with each other (r range: 0.60-0.76). The multifactorial model with all three measures best predicted group membership (F(3,30)=7.20, P=0.001; R2=0.42; percent classified correctly=77{\%}), and was followed by the multifactorial model with resultant center-of-pressure velocity and error score (F(2,31)=8.73, P=0.001; R2=0.36; percent classified correctly=74{\%}). The resultant center-of-pressure velocity (F(1,32)=13.46, P=0.001; R2=0.30; percent classified correctly=74{\%}; unique variance=12.7{\%}) and error score (F(1,32)=12.51, P=0.001; R2=0.28; percent classified correctly=71{\%}; unique variance=12.0{\%}) predicted group membership; however, 95th percentile center-of-pressure area ellipse did not (F(1,32)=4.16, P=0.05; R2=0.12; percent classified correctly=65{\%}; unique variance=5.8{\%}). A multifactorial single leg balance assessment is best for predicting group membership. COPV is the best single predictor of group membership, but clinicians may use error score to identify deficits associated with FAI if force plates are not available. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Historically, the ability of coaches to prescribe training to achieve optimal athletic performance can be attributed to many years of personal experience. A more modern approach is to adopt scientific methods in the development of optimal training programmes. However, there is not much research in this area, particularly into the quantification of training programmes and their effects on physiological adaptation and subsequent performance. Several methods have been used to quantify training load, including questionnaires, diaries, physiological monitoring and direct observation. More recently, indices of training stress have been proposed, including the training impulse, which uses heart rate measurements and training load, and session rating of perceived exertion measurements, which utilizes subjective perception of effort scores and duration of exercise. Although physiological adaptations to training are well documented, their influence on performance has not been accurately quantified. To date, no single physiological marker has been identified that can measure the fitness and fatigue responses to exercise or accurately predict performance. Models attempting to quantify the relationship between training and performance have been proposed, many of which consider the athlete as a system in which the training load is the input and performance the system output. Although attractive in concept, the accuracy of these theoretical models has proven poor. A possible reason may be the absence of a measure of individuality in each athlete's response to training. Thus, in the future more attention should be directed towards measurements that reflect individual capacity to respond or adapt to exercise training rather than an absolute measure of changes in physiological variables that occur with training.},

abstract = {This study is a methodological-substantive synergy, demonstrating the power and flexibility of exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) methods that integrate confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses (CFA and EFA), as applied to substantively important questions based on multidimentional students' evaluations of university teaching (SETs). For these data, there is a well established ESEM structure but typical CFA models do not fit the data and substantially inflate correlations among the nine SET factors (median rs D .34 for ESEM, .72 for CFA) in a way that undermines discriminant validity and usefulness as diagnostic feedback. A 13-model taxonomy of ESEM measurement invariance is proposed, showing complete invariance (factor loadings, factor correlations, item uniquenesses, item intercepts, latent means) over multiple groups based on the SETs collected in the first and second halves of a 13-year period. Fully latent ESEM growth models that unconfounded measurement error from communality showed almost no linear or quadratic effects over this 13-year period. Latent multiple indicators multiple causes models showed that relations with background variables (workload/difficulty, class size, prior subject interest, expected grades) were small in size and varied systematically for different ESEM SET factors, supporting their discriminant validity and a construct validity interpretation of the relations. A new approach to higher order ESEM was demonstrated, but was not fully appropriate for these data. Based on ESEM methodology, substantively important questions were addressed that could not be appropriately addressed with a traditional CFA approach.},

abstract = {Homeostasis, the dominant explanatory framework for physiological regulation, has undergone significant revision in recent years, with contemporary models differing significantly from the original formulation. Allostasis, an alternative view of physiological regulation, goes beyond its homeostatic roots, offering novel insights relevant to our understanding and treatment of several chronic health conditions. Despite growing enthusiasm for allostasis, the concept remains diffuse, due in part to ambiguity as to how the term is understood and used, impeding meaningful translational and clinical research on allostasis. Here, we provide a more focused understanding of homeostasis and allostasis by explaining how both play a role in physiological regulation, and a critical analysis of regulation suggests how homeostasis and allostasis can be distinguished. Rather than focusing on changes in the value of a regulated variable (e.g., body temperature, body adiposity, or reward), research investigating the activity and relationship among the multiple regulatory loops that influence the value of these regulated variables may be the key to distinguishing homeostasis and allostasis. The mechanisms underlying physiological regulation and dysregulation are likely to have important implications for health and disease. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether salivary cortisol measured by a simple enzyme immunoassay (EIA) could be used as a surrogate for serum total cortisol in response to rapid changes and across a wide range of concentrations. DESIGN: Comparisons of matched salivary and serum samples in response to dynamic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis testing. Subjects Healthy women (n=10; three taking oral oestrogens) and men (n=2), aged 23--65 years, were recruited from the community. Measurements Paired saliva and serum samples were obtained during three protocols: 10 min of exercise at 90{\%} of maximal heart rate (n=8), intravenous administration of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH; n=4), and dexamethasone suppression (n=7). Cortisol was measured in saliva using a commercial high-sensitivity EIA and total cortisol was measured in serum with a commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA). Results The time course of the salivary cortisol response to both the exercise and CRH tests paralleled that of total serum cortisol. Salivary cortisol demonstrated a significantly greater relative increase in response to the exercise and CRH stimuli (697+/- 826{\%}vs. 209+/- 150{\%}, P=0.04 saliva vs. serum). A disproportionately larger increase in free cortisol, compared with total, would be expected when the binding capacity of cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) is exceeded. In response to dexamethasone suppression, relative decreases in cortisol were not significantly different between the two media (-47+/- 56{\%}vs.-84+/- 8{\%}, P=0.13 saliva vs. serum). Although a significant linear correlation was found for all paired salivary and serum total cortisol samples (n=183 pairs, r=0.60, P{\textless}0.001), an exponential model provided a better fit (r=0.81, P{\textless}0.001). The linear correlations were strengthened when data from subjects on oral oestrogens (n=52 pairs, r=0.75, P {\textless} 0.001) were separated from those not taking oestrogens (n=131 pairs, r=0.67, P{\textless}0.001). Conclusions Salivary cortisol measured with a simple EIA can be used in place of serum total cortisol in physiological research protocols. Evidence that salivary measures represent the biologically active, free fraction of cortisol includes: (1) the greater relative increase in salivary cortisol in response to tests that raise the absolute cortisol concentration above the saturation point of CBG; (2) the strong exponential relationship between cortisol assessed in the two media; and (3) the improved linear correlations when subjects known to have increased CBG were analysed separately. Thus, an advantage of measuring salivary cortisol rather than total serum cortisol is that it eliminates the need to account for within-subject changes or between-subject differences in CBG.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) are impacted significantly by prolonged endurance exercise with inverse responses. Increases in C are witnessed concurrently with decrements in T, possibly impacting recovery. This study was conducted to assess the dynamics of C and free T (fT) concentration and recovery time following an exhaustive endurance exercise session (EES). METHODS 12 endurance-trained males (X ± SD: VO2max 66.3±4.8 ml/kg/min, age 22.8 ± 3.1 years, body fat 11.0 ± 1.4 {\%}, training 7.1 ± 3.2 years) completed a treadmill EES at ventilatory threshold (74.7 ± 4.6 {\%} of VO2max; 96.9 ± 10.8 min). Basal blood C and fT were collected at baseline: -48, -24 h, and immediately before (0 h) the EES as well as immediately (+0 h), +24 h, +48 h, and +72 h after the EES. Blood glucose (G) was measured to confirm no undue influence on C. Statistically data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA (LSD post hoc). RESULTS C (nmol/L) increased significantly from -48 h (321 ± 59) to +0 h (701 ± 178) (p {\textless} 0.001), and displayed a baseline overshoot with +24 h (209 ± 67) being significantly lower than -48 and +0 h (p {\textless} 0.03). fT (pmol/L) decreased significantly from -48 h (161 ± 40) to +0 h (106 ± 38) (p {\textless} 0.01) and remained lower at +24 h (110 ± 33) and +48 h (129 ± 30) (p {\textless} 0.001). G remained stable throughout. A moderately negative correlation (r = -0.636, p {\textless} 0.026) was found between C and fT at +0 h. CONCLUSIONS EES recovery may require 48 h for C and 72 h for fT to return to baseline values. Furthermore, C and fT were only correlated immediately post-exercise. Future research should perform more frequent measurements throughout time course.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a common knee injury, particularly among young and active individuals. Little is known, however, about the societal impacts of ACL tears, which could be large given the typical patient age and increased lifetime risk of knee osteoarthritis. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of ACL reconstruction compared with structured rehabilitation only. METHODS A cost-utility analysis of ACL reconstruction compared with structured rehabilitation only was conducted with use of a Markov decision model over two time horizons: the short to intermediate term (six years), on the basis of Level-I evidence derived from the KANON Study and the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) database; and the lifetime, on the basis of a comprehensive literature review. Utilities were assessed with use of the SF-6D. Costs (in 2012 U.S. dollars) were estimated from the societal perspective and included the effects of the ACL tear on work status, earnings, and disability. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS In the short to intermediate term, ACL reconstruction was both less costly (a cost reduction of {\$}4503) and more effective (a QALY gain of 0.18) compared with rehabilitation. In the long term, the mean lifetime cost to society for a typical patient undergoing ACL reconstruction was {\$}38,121 compared with {\$}88,538 for rehabilitation. ACL reconstruction resulted in a mean incremental cost savings of {\$}50,417 while providing an incremental QALY gain of 0.72 compared with rehabilitation. Effectiveness gains were driven by the higher probability of an unstable knee and associated lower utility in the rehabilitation group. Results were most sensitive to the rate of knee instability after initial rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS ACL reconstruction is the preferred cost-effective treatment strategy for ACL tears and yields reduced societal costs relative to rehabilitation once indirect cost factors, such as work status and earnings, are considered. The cost of an ACL tear over the lifetime of a patient is substantial, and resources should be directed to developing innovations for injury prevention and for altering the natural history of an ACL injury.},

Additionally, under the current Neyman-Pearson statistical structure, some argue that null hypothesis significant testing (NHST) under the frequentist approach is flawed, regardless. For example, a p-value is unable to measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, unable to measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result, and unable to provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis. Many of these downfalls are key questions researchers strive to answer following an investigation. Therefore, a shift towards a magnitude-based inference model, and eventually a fully Bayesian framework, is thought to be a better fit from a statistical standpoint and may be an improved way to address biases within the literature. The goal of this article is to shed light on the current research and statistical shortcomings the field of sport science faces today, and offer potential solutions to help guide future research practices.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). Many of today's global scientific challenges require the joint involvement of researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds (social sciences, environmental sciences, climatology, medicine, etc.). Such interdisciplinary research teams face many challenges resulting from differences in training and scientific culture. Interdisciplinary education programs are required to train truly interdisciplinary scientists with respect to the critical factor skills and competences. For that purpose this paper presents the Methodology for Interdisciplinary Research (MIR) framework. The MIR framework was developed to help cross disciplinary borders, especially those between the natural sciences and the social sciences. The framework has been specifically constructed to facilitate the design of interdisciplinary scientific research, and can be applied in an educational program, as a reference for monitoring the phases of interdisciplinary research, and as a tool to design such research in a process approach. It is suitable for research projects of different sizes and levels of complexity, and it allows for a range of methods' combinations (case study, mixed methods, etc.). The different phases of designing interdisciplinary research in the MIR framework are described and illustrated by real-life applications in teaching and research. We further discuss the framework's utility in research design in landscape architecture, mixed methods research, and provide an outlook to the framework's potential in inclusive interdisciplinary research, and last but not least, research integrity.},

abstract = {A model of the neuropsychology of anxiety is proposed. The model is based in the first instance upon an analysis of the behavioural effects of the antianxiety drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol) in animals. From such psychopharmacologi- cal experiments the concept of a "behavioural inhibition system" (BIS) has been developed. This system responds to novel stimuli or to those associated with punishment or nonreward by inhibiting ongoing behaviour and increasing arousal and attention to the environment. It is activity in the BIS that constitutes anxiety and that is reduced by antianxiety drugs. The effects of the antianxiety drugs in the brain also suggest hypotheses concerning the neural substrate of anxiety. Although the benzodiazepines and barbiturates facilitate the effects of •y-aminobutyrate, this is insufficient to explain their highly specific behavioural effects. Because of similarities between the behavioural effects of certain lesions and those of the antianxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs reduce anxiety by impairing the functioning of a widespread neural system including the septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures. Analysis of the functions of this system (based on anatomical, physiological, and behavioural data) suggests that it acts as a comparator: it compares predicted to actual sensory events and activates the outputs of the BIS when there is a mismatch or when the predicted event is aversive. Suggestions are made as to the functions of particular pathways within this overall brain system. The resulting theory is applied to the symptoms and treatment of anxiety in man, its relations to depression, and the personality of individuals who are susceptible to anxiety or depression.

abstract = {Sports injury prevention is a priority area in BJSM 1 and recent commentaries have stressed the need to consider relationships between sports injuries in longitudinal data sets. 2 3 Players can sustain none, one, or more than one injury over a season of follow-up. Subsequent injuries are statis-tically related to prior injuries because they occur in the same person. This is true even when the two injuries are clinic-ally distinct. 2 4 5 It is always important to collect, analyse and report data on subsequent injuries in injury incidence studies. Figure 1 shows a hypothetical cohort of five players fol-lowed over one season of 10-week dur-ation. This example assumes that all players are injury-free at the start of the season and addresses acute onset injuries rather than those due to repetitive microtrauma. The figure contains consid-erable information on each player: how long they were followed up; the number of injuries they sustained; how long before they sustained their first injury; and how long after any injury it took before they sustained their next one. Open circles indicate points at which players were injured, and stars indicate when follow-up was censored (eg, player 2 was only followed up for 7-weeks for non-injury reasons). A player does not accrue time at risk when he/she is unable to par-ticipate. For example, all of player 3's injuries result in time loss (TL) from the sport for healing and rehabilitation. None of player 5's injuries, on the other hand, result in any TL; these are known as non-TL injuries.},

Objectives: To report the intra-rater (one rater), inter-rater (two raters) and inter-session (one subject, sessions 1–5) reliability of lower extremity modified Ashworth scale (MAS) scores among patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: Tertiary Academic Rehab Centre in Toronto, Canada. Methods: MAS scores of 20 subjects with chronic SCI (C5–T10 AIS A–D412 months) were recorded for the hip abductors and adductors, knee flexors and extensors, and ankle plantar and dorsiflexors. MAS scores were assessed by two blinded raters (A and B) at the same time of day, weekly for 5 weeks using standardized test positions, a one-cycle per second metronome, with ratings recorded on the second cycle. MAS score reproducibility [intra-rater, inter-rater] were calculated using Cohen's Kappa. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to determine inter-session (trials 1–5) reliability; Kappa values X0.81 and ICC values X0.75 were desired. Results: Intra-rater reliability was fair to almost perfect (0.2oko1.0) and differed between raters. Inter-rater reliability was poor-to-moderate (ko0.6) for all muscle groups. Inter-session reliability for a single rater was fair-to-good (0.4oICCo0.75) for all muscle groups. Conclusions: MAS was not reliable as an intra-rater tool for all raters, and showed poor inter-rater and modest inter-session reliability. MAS has inadequate reliability for determining lower extremity spasticity between raters (inter-rater) or over time (inter-session). It is recommended that the rehabilitation science community seek alternative measures for quantifying spasticity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring athlete well-being is essential to guide training and to detect any progression towards negative health outcomes and associated poor performance. Objective (performance, physiological, biochemical) and subjective measures are all options for athlete monitoring. OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed objective and subjective measures of athlete well-being. Objective measures, including those taken at rest (eg, blood markers, heart rate) and during exercise (eg, oxygen consumption, heart rate response), were compared against subjective measures (eg, mood, perceived stress). All measures were also evaluated for their response to acute and chronic training load. METHODS: The databases Academic search complete, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus and PubMed were searched in May 2014. Fifty-six original studies reported concurrent subjective and objective measures of athlete well-being. The quality and strength of findings of each study were evaluated to determine overall levels of evidence. RESULTS: Subjective and objective measures of athlete well-being generally did not correlate. Subjective measures reflected acute and chronic training loads with superior sensitivity and consistency than objective measures. Subjective well-being was typically impaired with an acute increase in training load, and also with chronic training, while an acute decrease in training load improved subjective well-being. SUMMARY: This review provides further support for practitioners to use subjective measures to monitor changes in athlete well-being in response to training. Subjective measures may stand alone, or be incorporated into a mixed methods approach to athlete monitoring, as is current practice in many sport settings.},

abstract = {An epidemiologic systems analysis of diarrhea in children in Pakistan is presented. Application of additive Bayesian network modeling to 2005-2006 data from the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey reveals the complexity of child diarrhea as a disease system. The key distinction between standard analytical approaches, such as multivariable regression, and Bayesian network analyses is that the latter attempt to not only identify statistically associated variables but also, additionally and empirically, separate these into those directly and indirectly dependent upon the outcome variable. Such discrimination is vastly more ambitious but has the potential to reveal far more about key features of complex disease systems. Additive Bayesian network analyses across 41 variables from the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey identified 182 direct dependencies but with only 3 variables: 1) access to a dry pit latrine (protective; odds ratio = 0.67); 2) access to an atypical water source (protective; odds ratio = 0.49); and 3) no formal garbage collection (unprotective; odds ratio = 1.32), supported as directly dependent with the presence of diarrhea. All but 2 of the remaining variables were also, in turn, directly or indirectly dependent upon these 3 key variables. These results are contrasted with the use of a standard approach (multivariable regression).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Four studies were conducted with two primary objectives: (i) to conceptualize and measure mental toughness from a behavioral perspective; and (ii) to apply relevant personality theory to the examination of between-person differences in mentally tough behavior. METHOD: Studies 1 (n = 305) and 2 (n = 110) focused on the development of an informant-rated mental toughness questionnaire that assessed individual differences in ability to maintain or enhance performance under pressure from a wide range of stressors. Studies 3 (n = 214) and 4 (n = 196) examined the relationship between reinforcement sensitivities and mentally tough behavior. RESULTS: The highest levels of mental toughness reported by coaches occurred when performers were sensitive to punishment and insensitive to reward. Study 4 suggested that such performers are predisposed to identify threatening stimuli early which gives them the best possible opportunity to prepare an effective response to the pressurized environments they encounter. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that high level cricketers who are punishment sensitive, but not reward sensitive, detect threat early and can maintain goal directed behavior under pressure from a range of different stressors.},

The study comprised 339 active, competitive, non-pregnant athletes, aged 14-24 years from two sports clubs in the county of Aarhus, Denmark. The athletes answered a questionnaire about occupation and sports activity. One-leg standing balance was measured as the maximum time of one-legged balancing. The mean of the maximum time of one-legged balancing was 29 s (interquartile range 11.25-33.5 s). One-leg standing balance was positively associated with years of participation in basketball and was not associated with sex and age. We conclude that participation in basketball may induce significantly adaptive effects on standing balance.},

This book demonstrates the ways in which athletes and practitioners can transfer psychological skills to an injury and rehabilitation setting, to enhance recovery and the well-being of the athlete. Drawing on the very latest research in sport and exercise psychology, this book explores key psychological concepts relating to injury, explaining typical psychological responses to injury and psychological aspects of rehabilitation. Using case studies in every chapter to highlight the day-to-day reality of working with injured athletes, it introduces a series of practical interventions, skills and techniques, underpinned by an evidence-base, with a full explanation of how each might affect an athlete's recovery from injury. The Psychology of Sport Injury and Rehabilitation emphasises the importance of an holistic, multi-disciplinary approach to sports injury and rehabilitation. No other book examines the psychological aspects of both sports injury and the rehabilitation process, and therefore this is an essential resource for students, scholars and practitioners working in sport psychology, sports therapy, sports medicine or coaching"--},

The level of stress was evaluated by measuring the free cortisol response to awakening (cortisol awakening response; CAR) and by employing the perceived stress scale (PSS). Overall mood disturbance was measured using the profile of mood states (POMS). Postural control was evaluated using a force platform by measuring the 95{\%} confidence ellipse area described by the center of pressure during 5 balance positions maintained for at least 52 sec, each with open and closed eyes. The results of this study revealed a significant positive correlation between CAR, PSS and POMS for each of the studied subjects. Furthermore, it was observed that whilst the level of stress was capable of influencing postural stability, this influence was particularly evident when no visual information was available. Additionally, it was determined that maintenance of posture is easier when the dominant foot is ahead, regardless of visual input.},

Researchers in these fields routinely use frequentist statistical methods to evaluate the extent to which these interventions impact behavior and the hypothesized mediating processes in the population. However, calls to move beyond the exclusive use of frequentist reasoning are now widespread in psychology and allied fields. We suggest adding Bayesian statistical methods to the researcher's toolbox of statistical methods. Objectives: We first present the basic principles of the Bayesian approach to statistics and why they are useful for researchers in health psychology. We then provide a practical example on how to evaluate intervention effects using Bayesian methods, with a focus on Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We provide the necessary materials for introductory-level readers to follow the tutorial. Conclusion:: Bayesian analytical methods are now available to researchers through easy-to-use software packages, and we recommend using them to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for their conceptual and practical benefits.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in postural stability with fatigue of the frontal and sagittal movers of the lower extremities. There were four test sessions, with a randomized order assigned according to the muscles tested and the plane of motion. Subjects were 20 healthy men (age: 22.6 ± 2.4 years, height: 173.7 ± 3.6 cm, weight: 63.3 ± 7.9 kg). During each session, one set of muscle groups was fatigued using isokinetic contractions: ankle plantar/dorsi flexors, ankle evertor/invertors, hip flexor/extensors or hip abductor/adductors. The Biodex Stability System was used to assess anterior/posterior and medial/lateral stability before and after muscle fatigue. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that fatigue was associated with a significant increase in all stability indices. Fatigue of the hip movers, whether in the frontal or sagittal planes, led to greater increments in stability indices than fatigue of the ankle musculature. Fatigue of the frontal movers resulted in greater increases in the medial/lateral stability index compared to fatigue of the sagittal movers. In conclusion, fatigue of proximal lower extremity muscles affects postural stability and fatigue of the frontal movers is associated with postural instability in the frontal plane. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To summarize findings from a systematic exploration of existing literature and views regarding interdisciplinarity, to discuss themes and components of such work, and to propose a theoretically based definition of interdisciplinary research. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Two major data sources were used: interviews with researchers from various disciplines, and a systematic review of the education, business, and health care literature from January 1980 through January 2005. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of literature, one-on-one interviews, field test (survey). DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We reviewed 14 definitions of interdisciplinarity, the characteristics of 42 interdisciplinary research publications from multiple fields of study, and 14 researcher interviews to arrive at a preliminary definition of interdisciplinary research. That definition was then field tested by 12 individuals with interdisciplinary research experience, and their responses incorporated into the definition of interdisciplinary research proposed in this paper. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three key definitional characteristics were identified: the qualitative mode of research (and its theoretical underpinnings), existence of a continuum of synthesis among disciplines, and the desired outcome of the interdisciplinary research. CONCLUSION: Existing literature from several fields did not provide a definition for interdisciplinary research of sufficient specificity to facilitate activities such as identification of the competencies, structure, and resources needed for health care and health policy research. This analysis led to the proposed definition, which is designed to aid decision makers in funding agencies/program committees and researchers to identify and take full advantage the interdisciplinary approach, and to serve as a basis for competency-based formalized training to provide researchers with interdisciplinary skills.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to provide contemporary information on injury rates in an elite and sub-elite netball population and to explore the relationship between lower body stiffness and lower body injuries. One elite and two sub-elite teams of female netballers (n = 29) performed the vertical hop test to assess active lower body stiffness (K vert) and myometry to assess quasi-static stiffness. Lower body injuries were monitored via self-reporting and liaison with physiotherapists. Twelve lower body non-contact injuries were sustained by 10 players, equating to 11.29 lower body injuries per 1,000 exposure hours. The most commonly injured sites were the calf (33{\%}) and ankle (25{\%}). No significant differences between K vert of injured and non-injured players were reported, however, injured elite players recorded significantly higher season mean quasi-static stiffness in the soleus (p = 0.037) and Achilles (p = 0.004) than non-injured elite players. Elite and sub-elite netball players recorded a higher injury incidence than previous reports of injuries in recreational netballers. Within the constraints of the study, relatively high stiffness of the soleus and Achilles appears to be related to lower body non-contact injury incidence in female netballers, particularly at the elite level. These results provide a basis for development of injury prevention strategies.},

Successful prediction of susceptibility to ankle sprain injury with a simple test could allow ankle sprain prevention protocols to be initiated and help prevent disability in the athletic population. Objective: To investigate the ability of the single leg balance (SLB) test, carried out at preseason physical examination, to predict an ankle sprain during the autumn sports season. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: High school varsity athletics and intercollegiate athletics. Main outcome measure: Ankle sprains in athletes with positive SLB tests. Results: The association between a positive SLB test and future ankle sprains was significant. Controlling for confounding variables, the relative risk for an ankle sprain with a positive SLB test was 2.54 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.02 to 6.03). Athletes with a positive SLB test who did not tape their ankles had an increased likelihood of developing ankle sprains. The relative risk for ankle sprain for a positive SLB test and negative taping was 8.82 (1.07 to 72.70). A history of previous ankle injury was not associated with future ankle sprains in this study. The {\{}kappa{\}} value for interrater reliability for the SLB test was 0.898 (p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions: An association was demonstrated between a positive SLB test and ankle sprain. In athletes with a positive SLB test, not taping the ankle imposed an increased risk of sprain. The SLB test is a reliable and valid test for predicting ankle sprains.},

There is a need for an integrated perspective on sports injury that is inclusive of medical, behavioural (psychological, sociological, and organisational), physiological, and biomechanical factors. On the one hand, training and skills development are advocated as the best methods to reduce injury, but injury rates appear only to increase the more competitively a person approaches sport. This leads to the questions: are significant reductions in sports injury risk possible at all—or in only very specific sports, age groups, or competition levels—and only through absolute reductions in exposure, or after reconsideration of injury prevention methods? A biomechanically focused model of injury causation and prevention has been developed that draws on models by Wismans1 and Norton.2 From a biomechanical perspective, injury is “equivalent to the failure of a machine or structure”.3 Injury results from a transfer of energy to the tissue. The mechanical properties of human tissue, such as stiffness (stress–strain relation), ultimate strength, and critical stress, govern how the body responds to physical loads. {\ldots}},

abstract = {Greater levels of lower-body stiffness have been associated with improved outcomes for a number of physical performance variables involving rapid stretch-shorten cycles. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between several measures of lower-body stiffness and physical performance variables typically evident during team sports in female athletes. Eighteen female athletes were assessed for quasi-static stiffness (myometry) for several isolated muscles in lying and standing positions. The muscles included the medial gastrocnemius (MedGast), lateral gastrocnemius, soleus, and Achilles tendon. Dynamic stiffness during unilateral hopping was also assessed. Participants were separated into relatively stiff and compliant groups for each variable. A number of significant differences in performance were evident between stiff and compliant subjects. When considering the quasi-static stiffness of the MedGast in lying and standing positions, relatively stiff participants recorded significantly superior results during agility, bounding, sprinting, and jumping activities. Stiffness as assessed by hopping did not discriminate between performance ability in any test. Relationships highlighted by MedGast results were supported by further significant differences in eccentric utilisation ratio and drop jump results between stiff and compliant groups for the lateral gastrocnemius and soleus in lying and standing positions. Higher levels of lower-body stiffness appear to be advantageous for females when performing rapid and (or) repeated stretch-shorten cycle movements, including sprinting, bounding, and jumping. Further, the stiffness of the MedGast is of particular importance during the performance of these activities. It is important for practitioners working with athletes in sports that rely upon these activities for success to consider stiffness assessment and modification.},

abstract = {Physical exercise is important for people living under extreme environmental conditions to stay healthy. Particularly in space, exercise can partially counteract the loss of muscle mass and muscle strength caused by microgravity. Monitoring the adaptation of the musculoskeletal system to assess muscle quality and devise individual training programmes is highly desirable but is restricted by practical, technical and time constraints on board the International Space Station. This study aimed to test the feasibility of using myometric measurements to monitor the mechanical properties of skeletal muscles and tendons in weightlessness during parabolic flights. The mechanical properties (frequency, decrement, stiffness relaxation time and creep) of the m. gastrocnemius, m. erector spinae and Achilles tendon were assessed using the hand-held MyotonPRO device in 11 healthy participants (aged 47 ± 9 years) in normal gravity as well as in microgravity during two parabolic flight campaigns. Results showed significant (p {\textless} .05-.001) changes in all mechanical properties of both muscles and the Achilles tendon, indicating a more relaxed tissue state in microgravity. Recordings from a phantom rubber material with the device in a test rig confirmed that the device itself was not affected by gravity, as changes between gravity conditions that were too small ({\textless}1 {\%}) to explain the changes observed in the tissues. It is concluded that myometric measurements are a feasible, easy-to-use and non-invasive approach to monitor muscle health in extreme conditions that prohibit many other methods. Real-time assessment of the quality of a muscle being exposed to the negative effect of microgravity and also the positive effects of muscular training could be achieved using Myoton technology.},

abstract = {This review addresses the effects of fatiguing general muscular exercise (involving the whole body) and fatiguing local muscular exercise (involving a particular muscular group) on postural control. Short and intensive general exercise increases postural sway when the energy expenditure induced exceeds the lactate accumulation threshold. Exhaustive local exercise affects postural control when it generates a strength loss at least 25-30{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction. Non-intensive general and local exercises can also disturb postural control when the exercise is prolonged. Both general and local exercises contribute to altering the effectiveness of sensory inputs and motor output of postural control. Different compensatory postural strategies are triggered to counteract or limit the disturbance of postural control due to the general and local muscle fatigue. Conceptual models are proposed to explain how the central contribution privileges certain sensory information and neglects and/or compensates other information and improves motor output of postural control by developing motor strategies according to the context of muscle fatigue. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose To evaluate common modeling strategies in training load and injury risk research when modeling continuous variables and interpreting continuous risk estimates; and present improved modeling strategies. Method Workload data were pooled from Australian football (n = 2550) and soccer (n = 23,742) populations to create a representative sample of acute:chronic workload ratio observations for team sports. Injuries were simulated in the data using three predefined risk profiles (U-shaped, flat and S-shaped). One-hundred data sets were simulated with sample sizes of 1000 and 5000 observations. Discrete modeling methods were compared with continuous methods (spline regression and fractional polynomials) for their ability to fit the defined risk profiles. Models were evaluated using measures of discrimination (area under receiver operator characteristic [ROC] curve) and calibration (Brier score, logarithmic scoring). Results Discrete models were inferior to continuous methods for fitting the true injury risk profiles in the data. Discrete methods had higher false discovery rates (16{\%}-21{\%}) than continuous methods (3{\%}-7{\%}). Evaluating models using the area under the ROC curve incorrectly identified discrete models as superior in over 30{\%} of simulations. Brier and logarithmic scoring was more suited to assessing model performance with less than 6{\%} discrete model selection rate. Conclusions Many studies on the relationship between training loads and injury that have used regression modeling have significant limitations due to improper discretization of continuous variables and risk estimates. Continuous methods are more suited to modeling the relationship between training load and injury. Comparing injury risk models using ROC curves can lead to inferior model selection. Measures of calibration are more informative judging the utility of injury risk models.},

abstract = {The quantification and monitoring of training load (TL) has been the topic of many scientific works in the last fifteen years. TL monitoring helps coaches to individually prescribe, follow-up, analyse, adjust and programme training sessions. In particular, the aim of the present review was to provide a critical literature report regarding different physiological markers of TL monitoring, particularly in soccer, as the load is specific to individual sports. Therefore, the interests and limitations of heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV) and biochemical variables (blood, urinary and hormonal variations) were analysed, with a special focus on daily measures (before, during and after training) and monitoring throughout a whole season. It appears that the most relevant markers were the resting HR before training, HR reserve during training, HRV during rest days, blood lactate, and blood and salivary immunological status in follow-ups throughout the season. Urinary markers indicative of the players' hydration status also deserve attention. However, these objective markers should be considered with a subjective marker of TL such as the rating of perceived exertion to give a more precise quantification of TL and its perception. Future research could be directed towards urinary marker analysis and the analysis of specific markers of TL, which could be related to injury occurrence and to performance during competition.},

abstract = {Learning structure from data is one of the most important fundamental tasks of Bayesian network research. Particularly, learning optional structure of Bayesian network is a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard problem. To solve this problem, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed, and some of them learn Bayesian network structure with the help of different types of prior knowledge. However, the existing algorithms have some restrictions on the prior knowledge, such as quality restriction and use restriction. This makes it difficult to use the prior knowledge well in these algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the prior knowledge into the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and propose an algorithm called Constrained MCMC (C-MCMC) algorithm to learn the structure of the Bayesian network. Three types of prior knowledge are defined: existence of parent node, absence of parent node, and distribution knowledge including the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of edges and the probability distribution (PD) of nodes. All of these types of prior knowledge are easily used in this algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method C-MCMC.},

abstract = {Background: The Equivital (EQ02) is a multi-parameter telemetric device offering both real-time and/or retrospective, synchronized monitoring of ECG, HR, and HRV, respiration, activity, and temperature. Unlike the Holter, which is the gold standard for continuous ECG measurement, EQO2 continuously monitors ECG via electrodes interwoven in the textile of a wearable belt. Objective: To compare EQ02 with the Holter for continuous home measurement of ECG, heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV). Methods: Eighteen healthy participants wore, simultaneously for 24 h, the Holter and EQ02 monitors. Per participant, averaged HR, and HRV per 5 min from the two devices were compared using Pearson correlation, paired T-test, and Bland-Altman analyses. Accuracy and precision metrics included mean absolute relative difference (MARD). Results: Artifact content of EQ02 data varied widely between (range 1.93-56.45{\%}) and within (range 0.75-9.61{\%}) participants. Comparing the EQ02 to the Holter, the Pearson correlations were respectively 0.724, 0.955, and 0.997 for datasets containing all data and data with {\textless} 50 or {\textless} 20{\%} artifacts respectively. For datasets containing respectively all data, data with {\textless} 50, or {\textless} 20{\%} artifacts, bias estimated by Bland-Altman analysis was -2.8, -1.0, and -0.8 beats per minute and 24 h MARD was 7.08, 3.01, and 1.5. After selecting a 3-h stretch of data containing 1.15{\%} artifacts, Pearson correlation was 0.786 for HRV measured as standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). Conclusions: Although the EQ02 can accurately measure ECG and HRV, its accuracy and precision is highly dependent on artifact content. This is a limitation for clinical use in individual patients. However, the advantages of the EQ02 (ability to simultaneously monitor several physiologic parameters) may outweigh its disadvantages (higher artifact load) for research purposes and/ or for home monitoring in larger groups of study participants. Further studies can be aimed at minimizing the artifacts.},

This article assessed the validity of RR intervals and heart rate variability (HRV) data obtained using an HRM during incremen-tal exercise and artefact correction methods. Eighteen partic-ipants completed an active orthostatic test and incremental running V {\_} O 2 max test, while simultaneous recordings using a Polar V800 HRM and an electrocardiogram were made. Artefacts were corrected by deletion; degree zero, linear, cubic, and spline interpolation; and Kubios HRV software. Agreement was assessed using percentage bias, effect size (ES), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LoA). Artefacts increased relative to exercise intensity, to a peak of 4.46{\%} during 80–100{\%} V {\_} O 2 max. Correction of RR intervals was necessary with unac-ceptably increased bias, LoA, and ES and reduced ICC in all but resting recordings. All correction methods resulted in data with reduced percentage bias and ES for resting and ,60{\%} V {\_} O 2 max recordings. However, at .60{\%} V {\_} O 2 max, even with correction, large amounts of variation were present in HRV measures of root mean square of the successive difference of intervals, low-to-high frequency ratio, Poincar{\'{e}} dispersion perpendicular to the axis (SD1), and sample entropy. Linear interpolation produced RR intervals with the lowest bias and ES. However, caution should be given to HRV parameters at high exercise intensities, as large amounts of variation were still present. Recommendations for minimizing artefacts are discussed, along with guidelines for their identification, correc-tion, and reporting.},

abstract = {Objective Athletes anticipating sport competition regularly experience distinct emotional and physiological responses as a result of the expected psychosocial and physical stress. Specifically, cortisol, an indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, prepares the athlete for the psychological and physiological demands of competition. The objective of this meta-analysis is to analyse the magnitude of the anticipatory cortisol response in athletes preparing to participate in sport competition and to examine the influence of gender, level of competition and data collection time. Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Data sources Four electronic databases were searched to March 2017: PubMed, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Scopus. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies (1) Athletes participating in real sport competition;(2) salivary cortisol concentration collected before competition in addition to baseline sample(s);(3) original research article published in English language. Results Data from 25 studies provided 27 effect sizes. A significant anticipatory cortisol response of g=0.85, p{\textless}0.001 was identified. Males had a stronger trend for greater cortisol reactivity (g=1.07) than females (g=0.56, p=0.07). Females and athletes competing at international level did not demonstrate a significant anticipatory stress response. There were no significant differences between level of competition, type of sport or time of competition. Meta-regression indicated that the anticipatory cortisol response is greater when assessed closer to the start of competition (Q=6.85, p=0.009). Summary/conclusion The anticipatory cortisol response before sport competition reflects moderate cortisol reactivity that prepares athletes optimally for the demands of sport competition via the influence on cognitive processes and attentional control. However, both female athletes and international competitors did not demonstrate a significant anticipatory cortisol response, possibly due to differences in appraisal of the stress of sport competition.},

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of Classic League soccer players playing at the level under 12 through under 18. Injury history forms were mailed to all registering Classic League soccer players in the North Carolina Youth Soccer Association during 1997-2000 (n = 7000); 1483 (19{\%}) returned the baseline questionnaire and were followed up for injuries. RESULTS: There were 5139 player-seasons of follow up and an estimated 171 957 athlete-exposures. More than half self reported an injury history (59.7{\%}). Overall, the unadjusted incidence rate was 4.6 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 4.3 to 4.9) incident injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. Multivariate generalised Poisson regression modelling indicated that players with one previous injury had a twofold greater risk of incident injury (IRR = 2.6; 95{\%} CI 2.0 to 3.3), and those with two or more previous injuries had a threefold greater risk of incident injury (IRR = 3.0; 95{\%} CI 2.3 to 3.8) compared with athletes with no previous injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Injury history was associated with an increased injury rate. This suggests that, even in these youth soccer players, those with an injury history may be at higher risk.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) has become central to biobehavioral models of self-regulation and interpersonal interaction. While research on healthy populations suggests changes in respiratory frequency do not affect short-term HRV, thus negating the need to include respiratory frequency as a HRV covariate, the nature of the relationship between these two variables in psychiatric illness is poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between HRV and respiratory frequency in a sample of individuals with severe psychiatric illness (n = 55) and a healthy control comparison group (n = 149). While there was no significant correlation between HF-HRV and respiration in the control group, we observed a significant negative correlation in the psychiatric illness group, with a 94.1{\%} probability that these two relationships are different. Thus, we provide preliminary evidence suggesting that HF-HRV is related to respiratory frequency in severe mental illness, but not in healthy controls, suggesting that HRV research in this population may need to account for respiratory frequency. Future work is required to better understand the complex relationship between respiration and HRV in other clinical samples with psychiatric diseases. Severe mental illness is associated with a life expectancy almost twenty years shorter than the general population 1 . Increased mortality rates have been largely attributed to cardiovascular disease 2–4 with sudden cardiac death three times more likely in schizophrenia compared to the general population 5,6 . Moreover, rates of sudden cardiac death are even higher in patients using both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications 7 . Cardiorespiratory autonomic dysfunction has been suggested as an underlying mechanism of sudden cardiac death in severe mental illness 8 . The calculation of heart rate variability (HRV), which is the fluctuation of instantaneous heart period over time, provides a non-invasive proximal measure of cardiac vagal modulation 9,10 . Originally used as a tool to identify fetal distress 11 , HRV was later adopted to predict the risk of mortality in healthy adults 12,13 and after a coronary heart disease event 14–16 due to decreased parasympathetic output lowering the threshold for ventricular fibrillation 17,18 . HRV has also become central to biobehavioral models of self-regulation and interpersonal inter-action as it is a relatively inexpensive means to investigate the relationship between autonomic regulation and behavior 19,20 . While early work on HRV primarily used 24-hour Holter monitoring (e.g., refs 21–23), most recent research within the biobehavioral sciences adopts short-term recordings, typically between 2–5 minutes. Respiratory parameters (e.g., depth and frequency) are related to heart rate (HR) 24–27},

abstract = {Objective: To summarize 16 years of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) injury surveillance data for 15 sports and to identify potential modifiable risk factors to target for injury prevention initiatives. Background: In 1982, the NCAA began collecting standardized injury and exposure data for collegiate sports through its Injury Surveillance System (ISS). This special issue reviews 182 000 injuries and slightly more than 1 million exposure records captured over a 16-year time period (1988–1989 through 2003–2004). Game and practice injuries that required medical attention and resulted in at least 1 day of time loss were included. An exposure was defined as 1 athlete participating in 1 practice or game and is expressed as an athlete-exposure (A-E). Main Results: Combining data for all sports, injury rates were statistically significantly higher in games (13.8 injuries per 1000 A-Es) than in practices (4.0 injuries per 1000 A-Es), and preseason practice injury rates (6.6 injuries per 1000 A-Es) were significantly higher than both in-season (2.3 injuries per 1000 A-Es) and postseason (1.4 injuries per 1000 A-Es) practice rates. No significant change in game or practice injury rates was noted over the 16 years. More than 50{\%} of all injuries were to the lower extremity. Ankle ligament sprains were the most common injury over all sports, accounting for 15{\%} of all reported injuries. Rates of concussions and anterior cruciate ligament injuries increased significantly (average annual increases of 7.0{\%} and 1.3{\%}, respectively) over the sample period. These trends may reflect improvements in identification of these injuries, especially for concussion, over time. Football had the highest injury rates for both practices (9.6 injuries per 1000 A-Es) and games (35.9 injuries per 1000 A-Es), whereas men's baseball had the lowest rate in practice (1.9 injuries per 1000 A-Es) and women's softball had the lowest rate in games (4.3 injuries per 1000 A-Es). Recommendations: In general, participation in college athletics is safe, but these data indicate modifiable factors that, if addressed through injury prevention initiatives, may contribute to lower injury rates in collegiate sports.},

@article{Gisselman2016,
abstract = {Accurate detection and prevention of overuse musculoskeletal injuries is limited by the nature of somatic tissue injury. In the pathogenesis of overuse injuries, it is well recognized that an abnormal inflammatory response occurs within somatic tissue before pain is perceived which can disrupt the normal remodeling process and lead to subsequent degeneration. Current overuse injury prevention methods focused on biomechanical faults or performance standards lack the sensitivity needed to identify the status of tissue injury or repair. Recent evidence has revealed an apparent increase in the prevalence and impact of overuse musculoskeletal injuries in athletics. When compared to acute injuries, overuse injuries have a potentially greater negative impact on athletes' overall health burden. Further, return to sport rehabilitation following overuse injury is complicated by the fact that the absence of pain does not equate to complete physiological healing of the injured tissue. Together, this highlights the need for exercise monitoring and injury prevention methods which incorporate assessment of somatic tissue response to loading. One system primarily involved in the activation of pathways and neuromediators responsible for somatic tissue repair is the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Although not completely understood, emerging research supports the critical importance of peripheral ANS activity in the health and repair of somatic tissue injury. Due to its significant contributions to cardiac function, ANS activity can be measured indirectly with heart rate monitoring. Heart rate variability (HRV) is one index of ANS activity that has been used to investigate the relationship between athletes' physiological response to accumulating training load. Research findings indicated that HRV may provide a reflection of ANS homeostasis, or the body's stress-recovery status. This noninvasive marker of the body's primary driver of recovery has the potential to incorporate important and as yet unmonitored physiological mechanisms involved in overuse injury development. We hypothesize that abnormal somatic tissue response to accumulating microtrauma may modulate ANS activity at the level of HRV. Exploring the link between HRV modulation and somatic tissue injury has the potential to reveal the putative role of ANS homeostasis on overuse musculoskeletal injury development.},

As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

Pearson's correlations quantified the relationships and participants were also separated into relatively stiff (SG) and compliant groups (CG) for each variable. When ranked by Kvert the SG exhibited superior performance during sprinting, agility, jumping and strength (p ≤ 0.05) and when ranked by RF stiffness, SG exhibited superior sprint, agility and drop jump performance (p ≤ 0.05), while MG and BF stiffness were not related to performance. Higher stiffness appears to be beneficial to athletic performance for football players and therefore it may be beneficial for practitioners working with athletes that are required to perform dynamic activities to consider the contribution of stiffness to athletic performance.},

Allostasis refers to the adaptive processes that maintain homeostasis through the production of mediators such as adrenalin, cortisol and other chemical messengers. These mediators of the stress response promote adaptation in the aftermath of acute stress, but they also contribute to allostatic overload, the wear and tear on the body and brain that result from being "stressed out". This conceptual framework has created a need to know how to improve the efficiency of the adaptive response to stressors while minimizing overactivity of the same systems, since such overactivity results in many of the common diseases of modern life. This framework has also helped to demystify the biology of stress by emphasizing the protective as well as the damaging effects of the body's attempts to cope with the challenges known as stressors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The protection of athletes' health by preventing injuries is an important task for international sports federations. Standardised injury surveillance provides not only important epidemiological information, but also directions for injury prevention, and the opportunity for monitoring long-term changes in the frequency and circumstances of injury. Numerous studies have evaluated sports injuries during the season, but few have focused on injuries during major sport events such as World Championships, World Cups or the Olympic Games. OBJECTIVES: To provide an injury surveillance system for multi-sports tournaments, using the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing as an example. METHODS: A group of experienced researchers reviewed existing injury report systems and developed a scientific sound and concise injury surveillance system for large multi-sport events. RESULTS: The injury report system for multi-sport events is based on an established system for team sports tournaments and has proved feasible for individual sports during the International Association of Athletics Federations World Championships in Athletics 2007. The most important principles and advantages of the system are comprehensive definition of injury, injury report by the physician responsible for the athlete, a single-page report of all injuries, and daily report irrespective of whether or not an injury occurred. Implementation of the injury surveillance system, all definitions, the report form, and the analysis of data are described in detail to enable other researchers to implement the injury surveillance system in any sports tournament. CONCLUSION: The injury surveillance system has been accepted by experienced team physicians and shown to be feasible for single-sport and multi-sport events. It can be modified depending on the specific objectives of a certain sport or research question; however, a standardised use of injury definition, report forms and methodology will ensure the comparability of results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recommendations exist to encourage safe youth participation in sport. These recommendations include not specializing in 1 sport, limiting participation to less than 8 months per year, and limiting participation to fewer hours per week than a child's age. However, limited evidence exists to support or refute these recommendations. HYPOTHESIS High levels of specialization will be associated with a history of injuries and especially overuse injuries, independent of age, sex, or weekly sport training hours. Athletes who exceed current sport volume recommendations will be more likely to have a history of injuries and overuse injuries. STUDY DESIGN Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS Youth athletes (n = 2011; 989 female and 1022 male; 12-18 years of age) completed a questionnaire regarding their specialization status, yearly and weekly sport participation volume, and injury history. Specialization was classified as low, moderate, or high using a previously utilized 3-point scale. Athletes were classified into groups based on either meeting or exceeding current volume recommendations (months per year and hours per week). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} CIs were calculated to investigate associations of specialization and volume of participation with a history of sport-related injuries in the past year ( P ≤ .05). RESULTS Highly specialized athletes were more likely to report a previous injury of any kind ( P {\textless} .001; OR, 1.59; 95{\%} CI, 1.26-2.02) or an overuse injury ( P = .011; OR, 1.45; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.99) in the previous year compared with athletes in the low specialization group. Athletes who played their primary sport more than 8 months of the year were more likely to report an upper extremity overuse injury ( P = .04; OR, 1.68; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-2.80) or a lower extremity overuse injury ( P = .001; OR, 1.66; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-2.30). Athletes who participated in their primary sport for more hours per week than their age (ie, a 16-year-old athlete who participated in his or her primary sport for more than 16 h/wk) were more likely to report an injury of any type ( P = .001; OR, 1.34; 95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.61) in the previous year. CONCLUSION High levels of specialization were associated with a history of injuries, independent of age, sex, and weekly organized sport volume. Athletes who exceeded volume recommendations were more likely to have a history of overuse injuries. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Parents and youth athletes should be aware of the risks of specialization and excessive sport volume to maximize safe sport participation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Human Kinetics, Inc. Purpose: To establish the validity of smartphone photoplethysmography (PPG) and heart-rate sensor in the measurement of heart-rate variability (HRV). Methods: 29 healthy subjects were measured at rest during 5 min of guided breathing and normal breathing using smartphone PPG, a heart-rate chest strap, and electrocardiography (ECG). The root mean sum of the squared differences between R-R intervals (rMSSD) was determined from each device. Results: Compared to ECG, the technical error of estimate (TEE) was acceptable for all conditions (average TEE CV{\%} [90{\%} CI] = 6.35 [5.13; 8.5] ). When assessed as a standardized difference, all differences were deemed "trivial" (average standard difference [90{\%} CI] = 0.10 [0.08; 0.13] ). Both PPG-and heart-rate-sensor-derived measures had almost perfect correlations with ECG (R = 1.00 [0.99; 1.00]). Conclusion: Both PPG and heart-rate sensors provide an acceptable agreement for the measurement of rMSSD when compared with ECG. Smartphone PPG technology may be a preferred method of HRV data collection for athletes due to its practicality and ease of use in the field.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Exponential growth in the population of older adults presents clinicians with special concerns about factors affecting risks for declines in cognitive and physical functioning. OBJECTIVES To examine the hypothesis that risks for such declines and for disease outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, are related to differences in allostatic load, the cumulative physiologic toll exacted on the body over time by efforts to adapt to life experiences. To present an operational definition of allostatic load, along with preliminary evidence of its predictive validity in relation to salient outcomes of aging. METHODS Data from a longitudinal, community-based study of successful aging were used to develop a measure of allostatic load based on 10 parameters reflecting levels of physiologic activity across a range of important regulatory systems. Allostatic load is the sum of the number of parameters for which the subject was rated in the highest-risk quartile. RESULTS Higher allostatic load scores were associated with poorer cognitive and physical functioning and predicted larger decrements in cognitive and physical functioning as well as being associated with an increased risk for the incidence of cardiovascular disease, independent of sociodemographic and health status risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Findings are consistent with the conceptualization of allostatic load as an index of wear and tear on the body, with elevations in allostatic load predicting an increased risk for a decline in cognitive and physical functioning as well as cardiovascular disease in a cohort of older men and women. From a clinical perspective, the concept of allostatic load may provide the basis for a more comprehensive assessment of major risks in the aging process.},

@article{Alberts2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by the American College of Sports Medicine. Purpose The aim of this project was to develop a biomechanically based quantification of the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) using data derived from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a mobile tablet device. Methods Thirty-two healthy young adults completed the BESS while an iPad was positioned at the sacrum. Data from the iPad were compared to position data gathered from a three-dimensional motion capture system. Peak-to-peak (P2P), normalized path length (NPL), and root mean squared (RMS) were calculated for each system and compared. Additionally, a 95{\%} ellipsoid volume, iBESS volume, was calculated using center of mass (CoM) movements in the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML), and trunk rotation planes of movement to provide a comprehensive, 3D metric of postural stability. Results Across all kinematic outcomes, data from the iPad were significantly correlated with the same outcomes derived from the motion capture system (rho range, 0.37-0.94; P {\textless} 0.05). The iBESS volume metric was able to detect a difference in postural stability across stance and surface, showing a significant increase in volume in increasingly difficult conditions, whereas traditional error scoring was not as sensitive to these factors. Conclusions The kinematic data provided by the iPad are of sufficient quality relative to motion capture data to accurately quantify postural stability in healthy young adults. The iBESS volume provides a more sensitive measure of postural stability than error scoring alone, particularly in conditions 1 and 4, which often suffer from floor effects, and condition 5, which can experience ceiling effects. The iBESS metric is ideally suited for clinical and in the field applications in which characterizing postural stability is of interest.},

abstract = {Hair cortisol has the potential to fill the methodological void of long-term cortisol assessment while becoming a widely accepted measure in biopsychology. This review critically examines the applicability and relevance of hair cortisol measurement specifically within the field of exercise and sport science. Current measures of the HPA axis only cover a brief time period, whereas hair cortisol is a unique, non-invasive means to capture long- term cortisol secretion. Studies have shown that individuals who have elevated cortisol secretion (e.g. due to diseases associated with a disturbed activation of the HPA axis or exposure to stressful life events) reveal increased hair cortisol. By contrast, only weak correlations exist between hair cortisol and perceived stress, and the direction of the relationship between hair cortisol levels and mental disorders is unclear. Acute exercise, however, results in increased levels of cortisol that eventually is reflected in higher levels of cortisol in hair samples and studies have shown that exercise intensity is related to hair cortisol level. Thus, elevated hair cortisol levels found among regular exercisers are not necessarily pathological. Thus, one should practice caution when associating athletes' elevated hair cortisol with poor mental health or disease. Hair cortisol analysis can contribute to a more complete understanding of how long-term cortisol elevation mediates stress-related effects on the health and performance of recreational exercisers and elite athletes. Nevertheless, it is crucial for exercise and sport scientists to consider whether their research questions can be adequately addressed, given that regular intense exercise results in substantially augmented hair cortisol levels.},

abstract = {Context: Prevention of a lower extremity sprain or strain requires some basis for predicting that an individual athlete will sustain such an injury unless a modifiable risk factor is addressed. Objective: To assess the possible existence of an association between reaction time measured during completion of a computerized neurocognitive test battery and subsequent occurrence of a lower extremity sprain or strain. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Preparticipation screening conducted in a computer laboratory on the day prior to initiation of preseason practice sessions. Participants: 76 NCAA Division I-FCS football players. Main Outcome Measures: Lower extremity sprains and strains sustained between initiation of preseason practice sessions and the end of an 11-game season. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified the optimal reaction time cut-point for discrimination between injured versus noninjured status. Stratified analyses were performed to evaluate any differential influence of reaction time on injury incidence between starters and nonstarters. Results: A total of 29 lower extremity sprains and strains were sustained by 23 of the 76 players. A reaction time cut-point of ≥ .545 s provided good discrimination between injured and noninjured cases: 74{\%} sensitivity, 51 {\%} specificity, relative risk = 2.17 (90{\%} CI: 1.10, 4.30), and odds ratio = 2.94 (90{\%} CI: 1.19, 7.25). Conclusions: Neurocognitive reaction time appears to be an indicator of elevated risk for lower extremity sprains and strains among college football players, which may be modifiable through performance of exercises designed to accelerate neurocognitive processing of visual input.},

abstract = {Postural steadiness in one-legged stance has potential for evaluation of unilateral injuries and disorders, but any test protocol must be demonstrated to be both feasible and reliable. A testing protocol for using a force platform to measure steadiness in one-legged stance with eyes opened and eyes closed was successfully developed, and its within-session retest reliability was investigated in a group of 24 young, healthy subjects. Strategies were used to minimize the loss of data for trials in which the subjects incurred significant loss of balance from the one-legged position. The performance scores examined were the standard deviation of the three orthogonal force components and the two horizontal center of pressure (CP) coordinates averaged over four consecutive five-second trials. The retest coefficients for all test conditions were substantially improved compared with testing protocols reported earlier. Retest reliability was higher for performance scores based on force measures than for performance scores based on CP measures. The difference was statistically significant in two of the stances, with a similar trend in the other two stances. Further, factor analysis showed that force measures were the best predictors of steadiness in one-legged stance. Analysis of variance failed to detect any systematic effect for leg preference or laterality on steadiness in one-legged stance with eyes opened or eyes closed in the healthy subjects with no history of injury (p{\textgreater}.05). The test protocol described enables the development of clinical or experimental trials with repeated-measures design using the subject's nonaffected leg as a control. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Psychiatric research has entered the age of ‘Big Data'. Datasets now routinely involve thousands of heterogeneous variables, including clinical, neuroimaging, genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic and other ‘omic' measures. The analysis of these datasets is challenging, especially when the number of measurements exceeds the number of individuals, and may be further complicated by missing data for some subjects and variables that are highly correlated. Statistical learning-based models are a natural extension of classical statistical approaches but provide more effective methods to analyse very large datasets. In addition, the predictive capability of such models promises to be useful in developing decision support systems. That is, methods that can be introduced to clinical settings and guide, for example, diagnosis classification or personalized treatment. In this review, we aim to outline the potential benefits of statistical learning methods in clinical research. We first introduce the concept of Big Data in different environments. We then describe how modern statistical learning models can be used in practice on Big Datasets to extract relevant information. Finally, we discuss the strengths of using statistical learning in psychiatric studies, from both research and practical clinical points of view.},

The injury prediction studies were mostly based on prospective designs, using regression analysis, and studied trait anxiety and life stress. The qualitative studies used mainly thematic analysis, and the intervention studies showed some promising effects, but also inconclusive results. We proposed five specific needs for future research: (a) focus on separate research cohorts, (b) variation in preventive intervention designs, including sound protocols conducting experimental studies, (c) focus on behaviours in relation to cognition, (d) application of repeated-measure designs, and (e) use of statistics that could test complex interactions and intraindividual differences. Future research attention should also be oriented towards the psychology of overuse injuries, biopsychosocial perspectives, and health economic evaluations. While progress has been made in research on psychological antecedents of sport injury, prevention, and intervention in the last 10-15 years, several methodological issues still remain to be further developed, as outlined in this article.},

abstract = {Objective Athletes anticipating sport competition regularly experience distinct emotional and physiological responses as a result of the expected psychosocial and physical stress. Specifically, cortisol, an indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, prepares the athlete for the psychological and physiological demands of competition. The objective of this meta-analysis is to analyse the magnitude of the anticipatory cortisol response in athletes preparing to participate in sport competition and to examine the influence of gender, level of competition and data collection time. Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Data sources Four electronic databases were searched to March 2017: PubMed, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Scopus. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies (1) Athletes participating in real sport competition;(2) salivary cortisol concentration collected before competition in addition to baseline sample(s);(3) original research article published in English language. Results Data from 25 studies provided 27 effect sizes. A significant anticipatory cortisol response of g=0.85, p{\textless}0.001 was identified. Males had a stronger trend for greater cortisol reactivity (g=1.07) than females (g=0.56, p=0.07). Females and athletes competing at international level did not demonstrate a significant anticipatory stress response. There were no significant differences between level of competition, type of sport or time of competition. Meta-regression indicated that the anticipatory cortisol response is greater when assessed closer to the start of competition (Q=6.85, p=0.009). Summary/conclusion The anticipatory cortisol response before sport competition reflects moderate cortisol reactivity that prepares athletes optimally for the demands of sport competition via the influence on cognitive processes and attentional control. However, both female athletes and international competitors did not demonstrate a significant anticipatory cortisol response, possibly due to differences in appraisal of the stress of sport competition.},

Correlations between the changes in state anxiety and the parameters of body sway were examined by Pearson's correlation analysis. The changes in the enveloped area of body sway and in the maximum length of the antero-posterior body sway showed a positive correlation with the changes in state anxiety (r=0.543 and 0.659, respectively). The data showed that an increase in anxiety caused instability in the control of postural balance. These correlations were abolished when the eyes were closed. In conclusion, anxiety affects the processing of visual input and influences the net performance of postural control. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the incidence of sports injuries in college athletes from the same institution from 1993 to 2013. METHODS Athletes from 13 modalities were interviewed about the presence and type of injury, type of treatment and time of withdrawal, based on the questionnaire "Injury Surveillance System" (ISS). Data were analyzed with graphs and tables of injury prevalence by gender, age, site of injury and modality. We also analyzed the average time of withdrawal of athletes, returning to sports practice and new lesions. RESULTS It was observed that 49.91{\%} of the athletes showed some type of injury, with similar incidence between genders; the most frequent injuries were the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the ankle sprain; the average withdrawal time was 11 weeks. ACL was the injury with greater impact on college sports career, especially given the time of withdrawal. CONCLUSION The most frequent injury, ACL, occurred most frequently in indoor sports such as handball and volleyball and had the highest number of cases treated with surgery and a longer average withdrawal time. More studies are needed to create a larger database in order to schedule preventive measures for amateur athletes. Level IV of Evidence, Epidemiological Study.},

Using specific training programmes, it may be possible to reduce the incidence of knee and ankle injuries. However, it is not known which programme components are the key to preventing knee and ankle injuries or how the exercises work to reduce injury risk. Our ability to design specific prevention programmes, whether through training or other preventive measures, is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the causes of injuries. A multifactorial approach should be used to account for all the factors involved-that is, the internal and external risk factors as well as the inciting event (the injury mechanism). Although such models have been presented previously, we emphasise the need to use a comprehensive model, which accounts for the events leading to the injury situation (playing situation, player and opponent behaviour), as well as to include a description of whole body and joint biomechanics at the time of injury.},

However, the psychological impact of injury has not been well documented. This study examined the psychological reactions to injury among 343 male collegiate athletes participating in 10 sports. All athletes were assessed using measures of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem during preseason physical examinations. Injured athletes along with matched controls were later assessed within one week of experiencing an athletic injury and 2 months later. A 4 x 3 (Injury Status x Time of Testing) repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (DM MANOVA) revealed that injured athletes exhibited greater depression and anxiety and lower self-esteem than controls immediately following physical injury and at follow-up 2 months later. These findings supported the general observation that physically injured athletes experience a period of emotional distress that in some cases may be severe enough to warrant clinical intervention.},

abstract = {PURPOSE This study was conducted to test, in mountain running route conditions, the accuracy of the Polar V800™ monitor as a suitable device for monitoring the heart rate variability (HRV) of runners. METHOD Eighteen healthy subjects ran a route that included a range of running slopes such as those encountered in trail and ultra-trail races. The comparative study of a V800 and a Holter SEER 12 ECG Recorder™ included the analysis of RR time series and short-term HRV analysis. A correction algorithm was designed to obtain the corrected Polar RR intervals. Six 5-min segments related to different running slopes were considered for each subject. RESULTS The correlation between corrected V800 RR intervals and Holter RR intervals was very high (r = 0.99, p {\textless} 0.001), and the bias was less than 1 ms. The limits of agreement (LoA) obtained for SDNN and RMSSD were (- 0.25 to 0.32 ms) and (- 0.90 to 1.08 ms), respectively. The effect size (ES) obtained in the time domain HRV parameters was considered small (ES {\textless} 0.2). Frequency domain HRV parameters did not differ (p {\textgreater} 0.05) and were well correlated (r ≥ 0.96, p {\textless} 0.001).

A common postinjury psychological response is elevated fear of reinjury. Objective: To provide an overview of the implications of fear of reinjury on the rehabilitation of athletes, including clinical methods to measure fear of reinjury; the impact of fear of reinjury on rehabilitation outcomes, including physical impairments, function, and return to sports rate; and potential interventions to address fear of reinjury during rehabilitation. Evidence Acquisition: PubMed was searched for articles published in the past 16 years (1990-2016) relating to fear of reinjury in athletes. The reference lists of the retrieved articles were searched for additionally relevant articles. Study Design: Clinical review. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Results: Fear of reinjury after a sports injury can negatively affect the recovery of physical impairments, reduce self-report function, and prevent a successful return to sport. Athletes with high fear of reinjury might benefit from a psychologically informed practice approach to improve rehabilitation outcomes. The application of psychologically informed practice would be to measure fear of reinjury in the injured athletes and provide interventions to reduce fear of reinjury to optimize rehabilitation outcomes. Conclusion: Fear of reinjury after a sports injury can lead to poor rehabilitation outcomes. Incorporating principles of psychologically informed practice into sports injury rehabilitation could improve rehabilitation outcomes for athletes with high fear of reinjury.},

abstract = {The purpose of this manuscript is to outline a new model representing a dynamic approach that incorporates the consequences of repeated participation in sport, both with and without injury. This model builds on the previous work, while emphasizing the fact that adaptations occur within the context of sport (both in the presence and absence of injury) that alter risk and affect etiology in a dynamic, recursive fashion. Regardless of the type of injury, it is often preceded by a chain of shifting circumstances that, when they come together, constitute sufficient cause to result in an injury. If we are to truly understand the etiology of injury and target appropriate prevention strategies, we must look beyond the initial set of risk factors that are thought to precede an injury and take into consideration how those risk factors may have changed through preceding cycles of participation, whether associated with prior injury or not. This model considers the implications of repeated exposure, whether such exposure produces adaptation, maladaptation, injury or complete/incomplete recovery from injury. When feasible, future studies on sport injury prevention should adopt a methodology and analysis strategy that takes the cyclic nature of changing risk factors into account to create a dynamic, recursive picture of etiology., (C) 2007 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.},

The model illustrates the connections betweenunderlying injury risk factorsthrough a series ofcausal dependencies. The quantitativepart of the model – the conditional probability tables, are determined using ТNormal distribution with parameters, derived by experts. The injury rates calculated by the network are in an agreement with injury statistic data and correctly reports the impact of various risk factors on injury rates. The model is designed to assist coaches and supporting teams in planning the training activity so that injuries are minimized. This study provides important background for further data collection and research necessary to improve the precision of the quantitative predictions of the model.},

abstract = {We draw on the theory of allostasis to develop an integrative model of the current stress process that highlights the brain as a dynamically adapting interface between the changing environment and the biological self. We review evidence that the core emotional regions of the brain constitute the primary mediator of the well-established association between stress and health, as well as the neural focus of wear and tear due to ongoing adaptation. This mediation, in turn, allows us to model the interplay over time between context, current stressor exposure, internal regulation of bodily processes, and health outcomes. We illustrate how this approach facilitates the integration of current findings in human neuroscience and genetics with key constructs from stress models from the social and life sciences, with implications for future research and the design of interventions targeting individuals at risk.},

abstract = {The in vivo assessment of the biomechanical properties of the skeletal muscle is a complex issue because the muscle is an anisotropic, viscoelastic and dynamic medium. In this article, these mechanical properties are characterized for the brachialis muscle in vivo using a noninvasive ultrasound-based technique. This supersonic shear imaging technique combines an ultra-fast ultrasonic system and the remote generation of transient mechanical forces into tissue via the radiation force of focused ultrasonic beams. Such an ultrasonic radiation force is induced deep within the muscle by a conventional ultrasonic probe and the resulting shear waves are then imaged with the same probe (5 MHz) at an ultra-fast framerate (up to 5000 frames/s). Local tissue velocity maps are obtained with a conventional speckle tracking technique and provide a full movie of the shear wave propagation through the entire muscle. Shear wave group velocities are then estimated using a time of flight algorithm. This approach provides a complete set of quantitative and in vivo parameters describing the muscle's mechanical properties as a function of active voluntary contraction as well as passive extension of healthy volunteers. Anisotropic properties are also estimated by tilting the probe head with respects to the main muscular fibers direction. Finally, the dispersion of the shear waves is studied for these different configurations and shear modulus and shear viscosity are quantitatively assessed assuming the viscoelastic Voigt's model. {\textcopyright} 2010 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine {\&} Biology.},

abstract = {Equal proximal and distal lengthening of rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were studied. Tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and EDL were active maximally. The connective tissues around these muscle bellies were left intact. Proximal EDL forces differed from distal forces, indicating myofascial force transmission to structures other than the tendons. Higher EDL distal force was exerted (ratio approximately 118{\%}) after distal than after equal proximal lengthening. For proximal force, the reverse occurred (ratio approximately 157{\%}). Passive EDL force exerted at the lengthened end was 7-10 times the force exerted at the nonlengthened end. While kept at constant length, synergists (tibialis anterior + extensor hallucis longus: active muscle force difference approximately -10{\%}) significantly decreased in force by distal EDL lengthening, but not by proximal EDL lengthening. We conclude that force exerted at the tendon at the lengthened end of a muscle is higher because of the extra load imposed by myofascial force transmission on parts of the muscle belly. This is mediated by changes of the relative position of most parts of the lengthened muscle with respect to neighboring muscles and to compartment connective tissues. As a consequence, muscle relative position is a major codeterminant of muscle force for muscle with connectivity of its belly close to in vivo conditions.},

@article{Billman2013,
abstract = {Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) {\textless}0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.},

abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to establish quantitative values for asymptomatic and symptomatic Achilles tendons. Design Cohort study with a single (cross-sectional) time point of patients diagnosed with unilateral Achilles tendinopathy and an asymptomatic group with comparative homogeneity. Methods A sample of 50 participants: 25 diagnosed with symptomatic unilateral Achilles tendinopathy (AT group) and 25 with asymptomatic Achilles tendons (control group 2). The asymptomatic side of the AT group was used as a control (control group 1). Measurements at 2 cm intervals on the tendon from its insertion at the calcaneum up to the musculotendinous junction were taken non-weight bearing (NWB) and weight bearing (WB) using the MyotonPRO. Results There was a significant (p{\textless}0.005) decrease in natural oscillation frequency (F) at points 2, 3 and 4 of the AT group (NWB condition) and points 2 and 3 for the WB condition. There was a significant (p{\textless}0.005) increase in logarithmic decrement (D) at points 2 and 3 signifying a decrease in elasticity. Dynamic stiffness (S) was significantly (p{\textless}0.005) reduced in the AT group at points 2 and 3 WB and point 3 WB. There was no significant difference in creep (C) observed between the symptomatic and asymptomatic tendons. There was a significant (p{\textless}0.005) increase in mechanical stress relaxation time (R) at point 2 NWB. There was a correlation between body weight and gender on tendon mechanics, with the symptomatic tendons. No significant differences were observed between the control group 1 and control group 2. Conclusions The MyotonPRO measured decreased stiffness over a section of the tendon corresponding clinically with Achilles tendinopathy. This may have potential in identifying risk of injury and informing rehabilitation, however further extensive research is required to generate baseline data for specific population groups monitoring variables over time. Age, gender and body mass index appear to have some bearing on the mechanical properties of the tendon but mainly in the tendinopathy group.},

The optimum temperature for marathon performance is generally about 10-12 °C. The optimum temperature may be lower for faster runners than for slower runners. Sweat evaporation limits the rise in core temperature, but dehydration will impair cardiovascular function, leading to a fall in blood flow to muscle, skin and other tissues. There is growing evidence that the effects of high ambient temperature and dehydration on performance of exercise may be mediated by effects on the central nervous system. This seems to involve serotonergic and dopaminergic functions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The cortisol awakening response (CAR) has been used as a biomarker of stress response in a multitude of psychological investigations. While a myriad of biochemical responses have been proposed to monitor responses to exercise training, the use of CAR within the exercise and sports sciences is currently limited and is a potentially underutilized variable. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to collate studies that incorporate both exercise and CAR, in an effort to better understand (a) whether CAR is a useful marker for monitoring exercise stress and (b) how CAR may be most appropriately used in future research. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted, following PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted using PubMed, SportDISCUS, Scopus, and PsychInfo databases, using search terms related toCAR and exercise and physical activity. RESULTS 10,292 articles were identified in the initial search, with 32 studies included in the final analysis. No studies investigated the effects of laboratory-controlled exercise on CAR. Variable effects were observed, possibly due to inconsistencies in study design, methodology, population, and CAR analysis. The available literature suggests a threshold of exercise may be required to alter the HPA axis and affect CAR. Moreover, CAR may represent a combination of previous exercise load and upcoming stress, making current interpretation of field-based observational research challenging. CONCLUSIONS More research is needed to fully elucidate the influence of exercise on CAR and address a number of gaps in the literature, including controlling exercise load, consistent sample collection, and CAR calculation and analysis.},

abstract = {The knowledge of surface electromyography (SEMG) and the number of applications have increased considerably during the past ten years. However, most methodological developments have taken place locally, resulting in different methodologies among the different groups of users.A specific objective of the European concerted action SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) was, besides creating more collaboration among the various European groups, to develop recommendations on sensors, sensor placement, signal processing and modeling. This paper will present the process and the results of the development of the recommendations for the SEMG sensors and sensor placement procedures.Execution of the SENIAM sensor tasks, in the period 1996-1999, has been handled in a number of partly parallel and partly sequential activities. A literature scan was carried out on the use of sensors and sensor placement procedures in European laboratories. In total, 144 peer-reviewed papers were scanned on the applied SEMG sensor properties and sensor placement procedures. This showed a large variability of methodology as well as a rather insufficient description. A special workshop provided an overview on the scientific and clinical knowledge of the effects of sensor properties and sensor placement procedures on the SEMG characteristics.Based on the inventory, the results of the topical workshop and generally accepted state-of-the-art knowledge, a first proposal for sensors and sensor placement procedures was defined. Besides containing a general procedure and recommendations for sensor placement, this was worked out in detail for 27 different muscles. This proposal was evaluated in several European laboratories with respect to technical and practical aspects and also sent to all members of the SENIAM club ({\textgreater}100 members) together with a questionnaire to obtain their comments. Based on this evaluation the final recommendations of SENIAM were made and published (SENIAM 8: European recommendations for surface electromyography, 1999), both as a booklet and as a CD-ROM. In this way a common body of knowledge has been created on SEMG sensors and sensor placement properties as well as practical guidelines for the proper use of SEMG.

Purpose: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and circuit training (CT) are popular methods of exercise, eliciting improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). However, direct comparisons of these two training methods are limited. We investigated the effects of HIIT and CT on CRF. Methods: Thirty-nine apparently healthy middle-aged participants [HIIT; mean age: 42.5 ± 12.3; V˙ O 2 max 31.5 ± 7.1 (ml kg −1 min −1 ); 52{\%} males; CT; mean age: 41.2 ± 12.9; V˙ O 2 max 31.4 ± 6.8 (ml kg −1 min −1 ); 57{\%} males] were randomly allocated to two sessions per week of HIIT or CT over 8 weeks. HIIT performed ten 1-min cycle-ergometry intervals at {\textgreater} 85{\%} HR max , separated by ten 1-min intervals of active recovery. The CT group performed up to 40-min of CT at 60–80{\%} HR max . CRF was measured using maximum oxygen uptake (V˙ O 2 max ), ventilatory anaerobic threshold (V˙ O 2 at VAT) and maximum oxygen pulse (V˙ O 2 /HR). Results: V˙ O 2 max increased by 12{\%} following HIIT (mean difference 3.9 ml kg −1 min −1 ; 95{\%} CI: 2.8–4.9; P {\textless} 0.001), and 3{\%} in CT (mean difference 1.0 ml kg −1 min −1 ; 95{\%} CI: − 0.4 to 2.0; P = 0.060). V˙ O 2 at VAT increased by 16{\%} following HIIT (mean difference 2.4 ml kg −1 min −1 ; 95{\%} CI: 1.6–3.1; P {\textless} 0.001) and 4{\%} in CT (mean difference 0.7 ml kg −1 min −1 ; 95{\%} CI: − 0.1 to 1.4; P = 0.085). V˙ O 2 /HR increased by 11{\%} following HIIT (mean difference 1.4 ml beat −1 ; 95{\%} CI: 0.9–2.0; P {\textless} 0.001) and 1{\%} after CT (mean difference 0.3 ml beat −1 ; 95{\%} CI: − 0.3 to 0.8; P = 0.318). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that HIIT led to greater improvements in CRF when compared to CT. Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03700671.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a known risk factor for mortality in both healthy and patient populations. There are currently no normative data for short-term measures of HRV. A thorough review of short-term HRV data published since 1996 was therefore performed. Data from studies published after the 1996 Task Force report (i.e., between January 1997 and September 2008) and reporting short-term measures of HRV obtained in normally healthy individuals were collated and factors underlying discrepant values were identified. Forty-four studies met the pre-set inclusion criteria involving 21,438 participants. Values for short-term HRV measures from the literature were lower than Task Force norms. A degree of homogeneity for common measures of HRV in healthy adults was shown across studies. A number of studies demonstrate large interindividual variations (up to 260,000{\%}), particularly for spectral measures. A number of methodological discrepancies underlined disparate values. These include a systematic failure within the literature (a) to recognize the importance of RR data recognition/editing procedures and (b) to question disparate HRV values observed in normally healthy individuals. A need for large-scale population studies and a review of the Task Force recommendations for short-term HRV that covers the full-age spectrum were identified. Data presented should be used to quantify reference ranges for short-term measures of HRV in healthy adult populations but should be undertaken with reference to methodological factors underlying disparate values. Recommendations for the measurement of HRV require updating to include current technologies.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) While subjects performed static and dynamic posturographic tests, we measured the center of foot pressure on a force platform. Spatiotemporal center-of-pressure measurements were used to evaluate the postural performance, and a frequency analysis of the center-of-pressure excursions (fast Fourier transform) was conducted to estimate the postural strategy. RESULTS Within a laboratory task, national soccer players produced better postural performances than regional players and had a different postural strategy. The national players were more stable than the regional players and used proprioception and vision information differently. CONCLUSIONS In the test conditions specific to playing soccer, level of playing experience influenced postural control performance measures and strategies.},

abstract = {We propose a color-based image descriptor that can be used for image indexing based on high-level semantic concepts. The descriptor is based on Kobayashi's Color Image Scale, which is a system that includes 130 basic colors combined in 1170 three-color combinations. Each combination is labeled with one of 180 high-level semantic concepts, like "elegant", "romantic", "provocative", etc. Moreover, words are located in a two-dimensional semantic space, and arranged into groups based on perceived similarity. From a modified approach for statistical analysis of images, involving transformations of ordinary RGB-histograms, a semantic image descriptor is derived, containing semantic information about both color combinations and single colors in the image. We show how the descriptor can be translated into different levels of semantic information, and used in indexing of multi-colored images. Intended applications are, for instance, image labeling and retrieval.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to measure the influence of breathing frequency (BF) on heart rate variability (HRV) and specifically on the Low Frequency/High Frequency (LF/HF) ratio in athletes. Fifteen male athletes were subjected to HRV measurements under six randomised breathing conditions: spontaneous breathing frequency (SBF) and five others at controlled breathing frequencies (CBF) (0.20; 0.175; 0.15; 0.125 and 0.10 Hz). The subjects were divided in two groups: the first group included athletes with SBF {\textless}0.15 Hz (infSBF) and the second athletes with SBF higher than 0.15 Hz (supSBF). Fatigue and training load were evaluated using a validated questionnaire. There was no difference between the two groups for the fatigue questionnaire and training load. However, the LF/HF ratio during SBF was higher in infSBF than in supSBF (6.82 ± 4.55 vs. 0.72 ± 0.52; p{\textless}0.001). The SBF and LF/HF ratio were significantly correlated (R=-0.69; p=0.004). For the five CBF, no differences were found between groups; however, LF/HF ratios were very significantly different between sessions at 0.20; 0.175; 0.15 Hz and 0.125; 0.10 Hz. In this study, BF was the main modulator of the LF/HF ratio in both controlled breathing and spontaneous breathing. Although, none of the subjects of the infSBF group were overtrained, during SBF they all presented LF/HF ratios higher than four commonly interpreted as an overtraining syndrome. During each CBF, all athletes presented spectral energy mainly concentrated around their BF. Consequently, spectral energy was located either in LF or in HF band. These results demonstrate that the LF/HF ratio is unreliable for studying athletes presenting SBF close to 0.15 Hz leading to misclassification in fatigue.},

The sports medicine physician plays an important role to risk-manage the health of the competing athlete in partnership with the coach and other members of the support team. The sports medicine physician needs to strike the right ethical and operational balance between health management and optimising performance. It is necessary to revisit the popular delivery model of sports medicine and science services to elite athletes based on the current reductionist multispecialist system lacking in practice an integrated approach and effective communication. Athlete and coach in isolation or with a member of the multidisciplinary support team, often not qualified or experienced to do so, decide on the utilisation of services and how to apply the recommendations. We propose a new Integrated Performance Health Management and Coaching model based on the UK Athletics experience in preparation for the London Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Medical and Coaching Teams are managed by qualified and experienced individuals operating in synergy towards a common performance goal, accountable to a Performance Director and ultimately to the Board of Directors. We describe the systems, processes and implementation strategies to assist the athlete, coach and support teams to continuously monitor and manage athlete health and performance. These systems facilitate a balanced approach to training and competing decisions, especially while the athlete is ill or injured. They take into account the best medical advice and athlete preference. This Integrated Performance Health Management and Coaching model underpinned the Track and Field Gold Medal performances at the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.},

Participants completed a battery of three stance variations (double, single, and tandem) on two different surfaces (firm and foam) while standing on a force platform. This arrangement allowed for simultaneous comparisons between forceplate sway measures and clinical assessments using the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). Significant correlations were revealed for the single-leg and tandem stances on the firm surface and for double, single, and tandem stances on the foam surface. These results suggest that the BESS is a reliable method of assessing postural stability in the absence of computerized balance systems.},

abstract = {The regulatory mechanisms involved in tendon homeostasis and repair are not fully understood. Accumulating data, however, demonstrate that the nervous system, in addition to afferent (sensory) functions, through efferent pathways plays an active role in regulating pain, inflammation, and tissue repair. In normal-, healing- and tendinopathic tendons three neurosignalling pathways consisting of autonomic, sensory and glutamatergic neuromediators have been established. In healthy tendons, neuromediators are found in the paratenon, whereas the proper tendon is practically devoid of nerves, reflecting that normal tendon homeostasis is regulated by pro- and antiinflammatory mediators from the tendon surroundings. During tendon repair, however, there is extensive nerve ingrowth into the tendon proper and subsequent timedependent appearance of sensory, autonomic and glutamatergic mediators, which amplify and fine-tune inflammation and tendon regeneration. In tendinopathy, excessive and protracted sensory and glutamatergic signalling may be involved in inflammatory, painful and hypertrophic tissue reactions. As our understanding of these processes improves, neuronal mediators may prove to be useful in the development of targeted pharmacotherapy and tissue engineering approaches to painful, degenerative and traumatic tendon disorders.},

There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 {\%}) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

abstract = {Measures of an athlete's heart rate variability (HRV) have shown potential to be of use in the prescription of training. However, little data exists on elite athletes who are regularly exposed to high training loads. This case study monitored daily HRV in two elite triathletes (one male: 22 year, VO2max 72.5 ml kg min(-1); one female: 20 year, VO2max 68.2 ml kg min(-1)) training 23 ± 2 h per week, over a 77-day period. During this period, one athlete performed poorly in a key triathlon event, was diagnosed as non-functionally over-reached (NFOR) and subsequently reactivated the dormant virus herpes zoster (shingles). The 7-day rolling average of the log-transformed square root of the mean sum of the squared differences between R-R intervals (Ln rMSSD), declined towards the day of triathlon event (slope = -0.17 ms/week; r2 = -0.88) in the NFOR athlete, remaining stable in the control (slope = 0.01 ms/week; r2 = 0.12). Furthermore, in the NFOR athlete, coefficient of variation of HRV (CV of Ln rMSSD 7-day rolling average) revealed large linear reductions towards NFOR (i.e., linear regression of HRV variables versus day number towards NFOR: -0.65{\%}/week and r2 = -0.48), while these variables remained stable for the control athlete (slope = 0.04{\%}/week). These data suggest that trends in both absolute HRV values and day-to-day variations may be useful measurements indicative of the progression towards mal-adaptation or non-functional over-reaching.},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate by use of a latent growth curve analysis framework whether athletes' individual levels and changes in hassle and uplift levels over a 10-week period could predict injury outcome in an elite junior soccer population. Design: A prospective design with repeated measurement points. Methods: Participants were 101 Swedish elite junior soccer players (67 males and 34 females). Ten sets of measures were taken on a weekly basis during which participants completed the Hassles and Uplifts Scale (HUS). Latent growth curve models were used to examine whether the level and change in psychological stress could predict the frequency of injury over the 10-week period. Results: The results show that injury occurrence was significantly associated with both the initial level of daily hassle and the change in daily hassle. High initial daily hassle levels and a smaller decrease in daily hassles were associated with injury occurrence. Moreover, injury occurrence was significantly associated with a greater decrease in daily uplift. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of focusing on state variables using prospective designs and appropriate analysis of within-person change to detect complex and dynamic associations across time in injury-prediction research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Sports Medicine Australia.},

abstract = {A comprehensive explanation of antisocial behaviour (ASB) needs to focus on both individual differences in personality and life events as potentially predisposing factors. The current studies investigated the relative influence of both of these in males and females. We used the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) of personality to investigate the extent to which dispositional approach and avoidance tendencies relate to ASB. In the first study, 287 participants reported their engagement in ASB and completed the RST Personality Questionnaire (RST-PQ). In the second study, a new sample of 282 participants completed the same measures as well as reporting the extent to which they had experienced life strains. Results from both studies showed a positive association between goal-drive persistence and ASB in males; while in females, a positive association was found between impulsivity and ASB. In Study 2, life strains explained further variance in ASB and this also show a gender differentiation: in males, there was a stronger relationship between financial strains and ASB while females showed an association between relational strains and ASB. Overall, results suggested that ASB is more pronounced in the male sample with an instrumental purpose while in the female sample personal life events are of more relevance.},

abstract = {The challenges posed by chronic illness have pointed out to epidemiologists the multifactorial complex nature of disease causality. This notion has been referred to as a web of causality. This web extends theoretically beyond risk markers. It includes determinants of emergence/non-emergence of disease. This web of determinants is a form of complex system. Due to its complexity, the determinants within such system are not linked to each others in a linear, predictable manner only. Predictability is possible only on a short-term basis, and unpredictability sets in over the long run. Understanding such a system of determinants calls for articulation and testing of complex models which synthesize our knowledge of multiple determinants at many scales, both biological and otherwise. Given the complexity of this web and existing knowledge about the nonlinearity of such systems, the following question is posed: Can the challenge of studying causality be adequately addressed if emphasis continues to be placed on using tools and methods that are geared towards looking at such system from a linear paradigm? Or is it time to add to the epidemiologic research agenda the notion of nonlinearity and its relevant form of analytical approaches that are being tested in other disciplines? Furthermore, the question posed here applies as well to the study of determinants of health. Addressing determinants of heath adds further complexity to our task.},

@article{Tosevski2006,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the findings of recent researches from selected empirical and nonempirical publications focused on stressful life events and physical health. RECENT FINDINGS: The findings can be divided into biological, psychological, and social issues concerning the important relationship between stressful life events and physical health. Growing evidence in the field of psychoneuroimmunology contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms by which stressful events affect physical health. The interactions between behavior, central nervous system, and endocrine system that might cause immunosuppression is the most fascinating finding in modern medicine, and its implications are important for the prevention and treatment of somatic illnesses. Trauma, abuse, and stressful events have been studied extensively, especially among vulnerable groups such as children, women, caregivers, and combatants. Risk factors and resilience were the focus of attention of some authors as well as the behavioral intervention for coping with stressful events. SUMMARY: The findings support old observations and case reports of a close link between stressful life events and physical health and emphasize the necessity of early recognition and timely management of stress-induced illnesses. Psychosomatic approach, multidimensional diagnostics, and treatment should be sine qua non in the integrated care of affected people and should improve their quality of life.},

Among those studies, only one examined gender differences although women in the general population are more likely than men to experience depression. No research to date has used interviews to assess depression despite their standard use among mental health professionals. In a quasi-experimental design, we used a self-report checklist and a clinical interview to compare depression among male and female athletes at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postinjury. Results revealed significant effects of group (injured vs. control) and time (since injury), and these effects were different for the two depression measures. We also explored the sensitivity and specificity of the user-rated checklist in identifying severely depressed athletes compared with the interview. Findings underscore the importance of multimodal approaches and clinical judgment when evaluating athletes' postinjury depression symptoms.},

The purpose of this research was to compare the validity and reliability of 3 in vivo methods of stiffness assessment using 1 cohort of participants. Methods To determine inter-day reliability, 15 female netballers were assessed for stiffness twice within 1 week using unilateral hopping (vertical stiffness), free oscillations of the calf, and myometry of various muscles of the triceps surae. To establish convergent construct validity, stiffness was compared to static and dynamic strength measurements. Results Test–retest stiffness results revealed that vertical stiffness produced moderate to high reliability results and myometry presented moderate to very high reliability. In contrast, the free oscillation technique displayed low to moderate reliability. Vertical stiffness demonstrated a significant correlation with rate of force development during a squat jump, whilst myometer stiffness measurements from 3 sites in the lower limb revealed significant correlations with isometric rate of force development. Further, significant negative correlations were evident between the eccentric utilisation ratio and various myometer stiffness results. No relationships were established between the free oscillation technique and any of the performance measurements. Conclusion These results suggest that vertical stiffness and myometry are valid and reliable methods for assessing stiffness.},

abstract = {(From the jacket) This book presents a neuropsychological theory of anxiety deduced from the behavioural effects of anti-anxiety drugs in animals and their mode of action in the brain. Anxiety depends on activity in a widespread network of structures in the brain, key roles are played by the septo-hippocampal system, its afferents and efferents, and ascending noradrenergic and serotonergic fibres which innervate the septo-hippocampal system. Theories and evidence as to the functions of the septo-hippocampal system are reviewed and an integration of previous views proposed. This allots to the septo-hippocampal system the function of comparing expected to actual events and controlling behaviour in the case of a 'mismatch' between the two. Thus anxiety is seen as arising in response to such mismatch. The theory is applied to the symptoms and therapy of anxiety, and to the personality of anxiety-prone individuals.},

abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats, called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\~{}}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({\textless} 5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time domain, frequency, and nonlinear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\~{}}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Nonlinear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

abstract = {Although respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a commonly quantified physiological variable, the methods for quantification are not consistent. This manuscript questions the assumption that respiration frequency needs to be manipulated or monitored to generate an accurate measure of RSA amplitude. A review of recent papers is presented that contrast RSA amplitude with measures that use respiratory parameters to adjust RSA amplitude. In addition, data from two studies are presented to evaluate empirically both the relation between RSA amplitude and respiration frequency and the covariation between RSA frequency and respiration frequency. The literature review demonstrates similar findings between both classes of measures. The first study demonstrates, during spontaneous breathing without task demands, that there is no relation between respiration frequency and RSA amplitude and that respiration frequency can be accurately derived from the heart period spectrum (i.e., frequency of RSA). The second study demonstrates that respiration frequency is unaffected by atropine dose, a manipulation that systematically mediates the amplitude of RSA, and that the tight linkage between the RSA frequency and respiration frequency is unaffected by atropine. The research shows that the amplitude of RSA is not affected by respiration frequency under either baseline conditions or vagal manipulation via atropine injection. Respiration frequency is therefore unlikely to be a concern under these conditions. Research examining conditions that produce (causal) deviations from the intrinsic relation between respiratory parameters and the amplitude of RSA combined with appropriate statistical procedures for understanding these deviations are necessary. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our objective was to identify cohort retention strategies and implementation approaches used in studies with high retention rates. METHODS Longitudinal studies with ≥200 participants, ≥80{\%} retention rates over ≥1 year of follow-up were queried from an Institutional Review Board database at a large research-intensive U.S. university; additional studies were identified through networking. Nineteen (86{\%}) of 22 eligible studies agreed to participate. Through in-depth semi-structured interviews, participants provided retention strategies based on themes identified from previous literature reviews. Synthesis of data was completed by a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS The most commonly used retention strategies were: study reminders, study visit characteristics, emphasizing study benefits, and contact/scheduling strategies. The research teams were well-functioning, organized, and persistent. Additionally, teams tailored their strategies to their participants, often adapting and innovating their approaches. CONCLUSIONS These studies included specialized and persistent teams and utilized tailored strategies specific to their cohort and individual participants. Studies' written protocols and published manuscripts often did not reflect the varied strategies employed and adapted through the duration of study. Appropriate retention strategy use requires cultural sensitivity and more research is needed to identify how strategy use varies globally.},

To undertake a feasibility trial of the Alexander technique and supervised exercise classes and perform exploratory biomechanical and neuromuscular physiological marker analyses to better understand mediators of recovery. Feasibility parallel-group randomised controlled trial. General practices in southern England. Patients with recurrent back pain (at least 3 weeks' duration of a current episode). Participants were allocated by an external randomisation line to four groups: (1) normal care, (2) 10 Alexander technique lessons, (3) 12 physiotherapy exercise classes, (4) Alexander technique lessons plus exercise classes. The feasibility outcomes were recruitment, acceptability and follow-up. The clinical outcomes were the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), days in pain, the Von Korff pain and disability scale, overall improvement, fear of activity, enablement, the Oswestry Disability Index and the Aberdeen pain and function scale. Laboratory-based markers were axial muscle tone and flexibility, electrical activity, muscle tone and mechanical properties of elasticity and stiffness, trunk strength, and proprioception. In total, 83 patients consented, 69 were randomised and 56 (81{\%}) were followed up at 6 months. Most patients had long-standing pain (median {\textgreater} 300 days of pain). The RMDQ and other instruments were sensitive to change and the preliminary evidence suggests that the Aberdeen scale could be a useful measure. Study procedures were feasible and three methods of recruitment were successfully piloted. At 6 months the control group had changed little (RMDQ 1 point lower than at baseline) and, compared with the control group, clinically important improvements in RMDQ were seen in all groups, albeit not significant [Alexander technique -3.0, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -6.7 to 0.8]; exercise classes -2.9, 95{\%} CI -6.5 to 0.8; combined Alexander technique + exercise classes -2.50, 9{\%} CI -6.20 to 1.19]. Novel biomechanical variables strongly associated with RMDQ score at 6 months were muscle tone (0.94 increase in RMDQ per unit increase in Hz, 95{\%} CI 0.48 to 1.40; p {\textless} 0.0001), lumbar proprioception (1.48 increase in RMDQ per degree, 95{\%} CI 0.83 to 2.12; p {\textless} 0.0001) and muscle elasticity (-4.86 increase in RMDQ per unit log decrement, 95{\%} CI -0.01 to -9.72; p {\textless} 0.05). At 3 months the Alexander technique improved proprioception and exercise classes improved trunk extension strength. At 6 months the Alexander technique improved the timing of multifidus muscle onset and the active straight leg raise test and exercise classes improved multifidus muscle thickness and the ability to contract. The combined effects of the Alexander technique and exercise classes were improvements in muscle tone, elasticity and thickness and contractile ability. These observations provide possible links between intervention, proprioception, muscle tone and elasticity and outcome. In terms of harms, one patient fell in the exercise class group. The trial is feasible and the interventions may provide clinically important benefits. Exploratory analysis suggests that muscle tone, elasticity and proprioception are strongly associated with improved RMDQ score and are likely to be modified by the interventions.

abstract = {Despite the health benefits of sports activities, sports injury and fear of injury are important barriers to participation in sport. The incidence, prevalence and type of sports injuries vary among men and women as well as age groups. It is usually difficult to examine these different aspects of sports injuries due to insufficient data. This study argues that sport injuries can be considered as an important economic burden in terms of the direct and indirect costs it bears. As a result, strong and effective strategies are needed to prevent sports injuries. Sports medicine has also been attracted increasing attention in recent years, particularly. In this article, the importance of sports injuries and their economic costs as well as the role of sport medicine as a prevention method for sports injuries were discussed.},

abstract = {We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. First and foremost, we develop a methodology for assessing informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived from a set of assumptions made previously as weil as the assumption of likelihood equivalence, which says that data should not help to discriminate network stmctures that represent the same assertions of conditional independence. We show that likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made assumptions implies that the nser's priors for network parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the next case to be seen--a prior network and a single measure of confidence for that network. Second, using these priors, we show how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network structures given data. Third, we describe search methods for identifying network structures with high posterior probabilities. We describe polynomial algorithms for finding the highest-scoring network stmctures in the special case where every node has at most k = 1 parent. For the general case (k {\textgreater} 1), which is Np-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms including local search, iterative local search, and simulated annealing. Finally, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms, and apply this approach to a comparison of various approaches.},

It is assumed that anxiety impairs efficient functioning of the goal-directed attentional system and increases the extent to which processing is influenced by the stimulus-driven attentional system. In addition to decreasing attentional control, anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli. Adverse effects of anxiety on processing efficiency depend on two central executive functions involving attentional control: inhibition and shifting. However, anxiety may not impair performance effectiveness (quality of performance) when it leads to the use of compensatory strategies (e.g., enhanced effort; increased use of processing resources). Directions for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the relative and absolute reliabilities of the myotonometer. Design: Psychometric study. Setting: Three medical centers. Participants: Patients with stroke (N=61). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Muscle tone, elasticity, and stiffness of relaxed affected deltoid, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, extensor digitorum, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris were measured twice, 30 minutes apart, using the myotonometer. Intraclass correlation coefficient, a relative reliability index, was calculated for 3 muscular properties and for each muscle to examine the degree of consistency and agreement between the 2 test sessions. Absolute reliability indices, including the SEM, smallest real difference, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement, were used to quantify measurement errors and check systematic biases of the 2 test sessions. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients were.83 to.95 for muscle tone, elasticity, and stiffness of all muscle groups. The SEM and the smallest real difference of muscle tone, elasticity, and stiffness of the biceps were the smallest among the 6 muscles tested. The Bland-Altman analyses showed no systematic bias between most of the repeated measurements. Compared with other muscles, biceps had narrower limits-of-agreement ranges, indicating that the myotonometric measurements of the biceps had higher stability and less variation over time. Conclusions: The myotonometer reliably measures muscular properties, with good relative and absolute reliabilities. These findings are useful for clinicians and researchers to assess muscle properties reliably and determine whether a real change has occurred in groups and on individual levels of patients with stroke. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {Jeffrey Gray's Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) represents one of the most influential biologically-based personality theories describing individual differences in approach and avoidance tendencies. The most prominent self-report inventory to measure individual differences in approach and avoidance behavior to date is the BIS/BAS scale by Carver and White (1994). As Gray and McNaughton (2000) revised the RST after its initial formulation in the 1970/80s, and given the Carver and White measure is based on the initial conceptualization of RST, there is a growing need for self-report inventories measuring individual differences in the revised behavioral inhibition system (BIS), behavioral activation system (BAS) and the fight, flight, freezing system (FFFS). Therefore, in this paper we present a new questionnaire measuring individual differences in the revised constructs of the BIS, BAS and FFFS in N = 1814 participants (German sample). An English translated version of the new measure is also presented and tested in N = 299 English language participants. A large number of German participants (N = 1090) also filled in the BIS/BAS scales by Carver and White (1994) and the correlations between these measures are presented. Finally, this same subgroup of participants provided buccal swaps for the investigation of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) gene. Here, a functional genetic polymorphism (rs11174811) on the AVPR1a gene was shown to be associated with individual differences in both the revised BIS and classic BIS dimensions.},

abstract = {Bayesian estimation for 2 groups provides complete distributions of credible values for the effect size, group means and their difference, standard deviations and their difference, and the normality of the data. The method handles outliers. The decision rule can accept the null value (unlike traditional t tests) when certainty in the estimate is high (unlike Bayesian model comparison using Bayes factors). The method also yields precise estimates of statistical power for various research goals. The software and programs are free and run on Macintosh, Windows, and Linux platforms. One of the most frequently encountered scientific procedures is a comparison of two groups (e.g., du Prel, R{\"{o}}hrig, Hommel, {\&} Blettner, 2010; Fritz, Morris, {\&} Richler, 2012; Wetzels et al., 2011). Given data from two groups, researchers ask various comparative questions: How much is one group different from an-other? Can we be reasonably sure that the difference is non-zero? How certain are we about the magnitude of difference? These questions are difficult to answer because data are contaminated by random variability despite researchers' efforts to minimize extraneous influences on the data. Because of "noise" in the data, researchers rely on statistical methods of probabilistic inference to interpret the data. When data are interpreted in terms of meaningful parameters in a mathematical description, such as the difference of mean parameters in two groups, it is Bayesian analysis that provides complete information about the credible parameter values. Bayesian analysis is also more intuitive than traditional methods of null hypothesis significance testing (e.g., Dienes, 2011). This article introduces an intuitive Bayesian approach to the analysis of data from two groups. The method yields complete distributional information about the means and standard deviations of the groups. In particular, the analysis reveals the relative credibility of every possible difference of means, every possible difference of standard deviations, and all possible effect sizes. From this explicit distribution of credible parameter values, inferences about null values can be made without ever referring to p values as in null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Unlike NHST, the Bayesian method can accept the null value, not only reject it, when certainty in the estimate is high. The new method handles outliers by describing the data as heavy tailed distributions instead of normal distributions, to the extent implied by the data. The new method also implements power analysis in both retrospective and prospective forms. The analysis is implemented in the widely used and free programming languages R and JAGS and can be run on Macintosh, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Complete installation instructions are provided, along with working examples. The programs can also be flexibly extended to other types of data and analyses. Thus, the software can be used by virtually anyone who has a computer. The article is divided into two main sections, followed by appendices. The first section introduces the Bayesian analysis and explains its results through examples. The richness of information provided by the Bayesian parameter estimation is emphasized. Bayesian power analysis is also illustrated. The second section contrasts the Bayesian approach with the t test from NHST. This section points out not only the relative poverty of information provided by the NHST t test but also some of its foundational logical problems. An appendix is provided for readers who are familiar with a different Bayesian approach to testing null hypotheses , which is based on model comparison and uses the Bayes factor as a decision statistic. This appendix suggests that Bayesian model comparison is usually less informative than the approach of Bayesian parameter estimation featured in the first section. The perils of NHST and the merits of Bayesian data analysis have been expounded with increasing force in recent years (e.g Wagenmakers, 2007). Nevertheless , some people have the impression that conclusions from NHST and Bayesian methods tend to agree in simple situations such as comparison of two groups: "Thus, if your primary question of interest can be simply expressed in a form amenable to a t test, say, there really is no need to try and apply the full Bayesian machinery to so simple a problem" (Brooks, 2003, p. 2694). This article shows, to the contrary, that Bayesian parameter estimation provides much richer information than the NHST t test and that its conclusions can differ from those of the NHST t test. Decisions based on Bayesian parameter estimation are better founded than those based on NHST, whether the decisions derived by the two methods agree or not. The conclusion is bold but simple: Bayesian parameter estimation supersedes the NHST t test.},

They did not have significant medical, neurological, or lower extremity problems that might have an adverse effect on balance. Results . There was a significant positive correlation between BESS scores and age ( r=.34 ). BESS performance was similar for participants between the ages of 20 and 49 and significantly declined between ages 50 and 69. Men performed slightly better than women on the BESS. Women who were overweight performed significantly more poorly on the test compared to women who were not overweight ( P{\textless}.0001 ; Cohen's d=.62 ).

Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in a 3-day dry immersion study. Before and immediately after exposure we measured maximal bite force using piezoresistive sensors. The mechanical properties of the jaw and cervical muscles were evaluated before, during, and after dry immersion using MyotonPRO. Because recent studies reported the effects of jaw motor activity on the postural stability of humans, stabilometric measurements of center of pressure were performed before and after dry immersion in two mandibular positions: rest position without jaw clenching, and intercuspidal position during voluntary teeth clenching. Results revealed no significant changes of maximal bite force after dry immersion. All postural parameters were significantly altered by dry immersion. There were however no significant differences in stabilometric data according to mandibular position. Moreover the masseter tonicity increased immediately after the end of dry immersion period. Dry immersion could be used as a valid model for studying the effects of microgravity on human subjects. However, 3 days appear insufficient in duration to evaluate the effects of weightlessness on maximal bite force. Our research suggests a link between postural disturbance after dry immersion and masseter tonicity.},

abstract = {The science of sports injury control, including both its cause and prevention, has largely been informed by a biomedical and mechanistic model of health. Traditional scientific practice in sports injury research has routinely involved collapsing the broader socioecological landscape down in order to analyse individual-level determinants of injury - whether biomechanical and/or behavioural. This approach has made key gains for sports injury prevention research and should be further encouraged and allowed to evolve naturally. However, the public health, Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics, and injury epidemiological literature more broadly, has accepted the value of a socioecological paradigm for better understanding disease and injury processes, and sports injury research will fall further behind unless it does the same. A complementary and alternative conceptual approach towards injury control known as systems thinking that builds on socioecological science, both methodologically and analytically, is readily available and fast developing in other research areas. This review outlines the historical progression of causal concepts in the field of epidemiology over the course of the modern scientific era. From here, causal concepts in injury epidemiology, and models of aetiology as found in the context of sports injury research are presented. The paper finishes by proposing a new research agenda that considers the potential for a systems thinking approach to further enhance sports injury aetiological understanding. A complementary systems paradigm, however, will require that sports injury epidemiologists bring their knowledge and skillsets forwards in an attempt to use, adapt, and even refine existing systems-based approaches. Alongside the natural development of conventional scientific methodologies and analyses in sports injury research, progressing forwards to a systems paradigm is now required.},

A high rate of injury was noted among these athletes (30{\%} - 46{\%} of the members of each team sustained at least one injury during the season). The injured athletes were found to have a significant increase in minor life events for the week prior to injury. No significant changes in minor life events occurred for the non- injured athletes. The results of the present study provide substantial evidence for a link between minor life events and athletic injury.},

abstract = {Data obtained from epidemiological studies of sports injuries are an essential requirement for developing injury prevention, treatment and rehabilitation strategies. Although many authors have discussed the strengths and weaknesses of research methods employed in epidemiology, the potential effects that variations in research design and methods of analysis can have on study conclusions have not been clearly illustrated. This article addresses a number of methodological issues and illustrates their potential effects using examples based on injury data obtained from a single, large epidemiological study in professional rugby unioin. The examples demonstrate that conflicting conclusions can be reached depending on how the data are collected and analysed. The pivotal roles played by injury definition (loss-of-time, missed matches, diagnostic assessment and surgery), recurrent injury definition (clinical judgement and same injury/same location/same season), method of reporting injuries (number, proportions and incidence) and method of calculating incidence (injuries per 1000 player-hours, per 1000 athlete-exposures and per 1000 matches) are highlighted and illustrated. Other examples show that if training and match injuries are combined, the incidence of injury is more likely to relfect the incidence of training injuries but the distributions of injuries are more likely to reflect the distributions of match injuries. an example is presented that demonstrates that the identification of injuries causing the greatest concern within a sport depends on whether the assessment is based on injury incidence, severity or risk. Finally, examples are presented to show that the relationships identified between sports injuries and risk factors may be dependent on whether case-control or cohort study designs are used. Although there are no simple solutions available to resolve the issues raised, the discussion demonstrates the importance, at least within a sport, of reaching consensus agreements on acceptable study designs and methods of data analysis in sports epidemiology.},

abstract = {Background The relationship between specific types of stressors (eg, teammates, coach) and acute versus overuse injuries is not well understood.

Objective To examine the roles of different types of stressors as well as the effect of motivational climate on the occurrence of acute and overuse injuries.

Methods Players in the Norwegian elite female football league (n=193 players from 12 teams) participated in baseline screening tests prior to the 2009 competitive football season. As part of the screening, we included the Life Event Survey for Collegiate Athletes and the Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire (Norwegian short version). Acute and overuse time-loss injuries and exposure to training and matches were recorded prospectively in the football season using weekly text messaging. Data were analysed with Bayesian logistic regression analyses.

Results Using Bayesian logistic regression analyses, we showed that perceived negative life event stress from teammates was associated with an increased risk of acute injuries (OR=1.23, 95{\%} credibility interval (1.01 to 1.48)). There was a credible positive association between perceived negative life event stress from the coach and the risk of overuse injuries (OR=1.21, 95{\%} credibility interval (1.01 to 1.45)).

Conclusions Players who report teammates as a source of stress have a greater risk of sustaining an acute injury, while players reporting the coach as a source of stress are at greater risk of sustaining an overuse injury. Motivational climate did not relate to increased injury occurrence.},

University level athletes, involved in 7 sport disciplines reported musculoskeletal injuries sustained in the past year, as well as potential risk factors: training volume and antecedent sport participation. Group comparisons were conducted. RESULTS 82 athletes participated in the study. Respondents sustained over two injuries per year. Significant differences were found for sport category and type of injury. No differences were observed regarding antecedent sport participation. DISCUSSION High prevalence and sport-specific injuries observed in university sport should be of concern to athletes, therapists, coaches and sport organizers.

Twelve patients with substroke (3 to 9 months poststroke) were examined in standardized testing position twice, 60 minutes apart, with the Myoton-3 myometer to measure tone, elasticity, and stiffness of relaxed bilateral biceps and triceps brachii muscles. Intrarater reliability of muscle properties was determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of measurement (SEM), and the minimal detectable change (MDC). Results. Intrarater reliability of muscle properties of bilateral biceps and triceps brachii muscles were good (ICCs = 0.79-0.96) except for unaffected biceps tone (ICC = 0.72). The SEM and MDC of bilateral biceps and triceps brachii muscles indicated small measurement error (SEM{\%} {\textless}10{\%}, MDC{\%} {\textless}25{\%}). Conclusion. The Myoton-3 myometer is a reliable tool for quantifying muscle tone, elasticity, and stiffness of the biceps and triceps brachii in patients with subacute stroke.},

LES and other psychosocial variables were measured, and peripheral vision was assessed in nonstressful (practice day) and stressful (game day) sport situations. Results showed that total LES, N-LES, and psychological coping skills significantly contributed to the prediction of the occurrence of athletic injury. Additionally, psychological coping skills buffered the N-LES/athletic injury relationship. Peripheral narrowing during stress significantly mediated 8.1{\%} of the N-LES/athletic injury relationship. The findings support the predictions of the model of stress and injury, provide evidence for peripheral narrowing as a mechanism in the LES/athletic injury relationship, and suggest directions for future research examining mediating effects in the model of stress and injury.

There are three main methods of discretization; manual, unsupervised, and supervised. Here, we compare and demonstrate each approach with a BN that predicts coastal erosion. Results reveal that supervised discretization methods produced BNs of the highest average predictive skill (73.8{\%}), followed by manual discretization (69.0{\%}) and unsupervised discretization (64.8{\%}). However, each method has specific advantages that may make them more suitable for particular applications. Manual methods can produce physical meaningful BNs, which is favorable in environmental modelling. Supervised methods can autonomously and optimally discretize variables and may be preferred when predictive skill is a modelling priority. Unsupervised methods are computationally simple and versatile. The optimal discretization scheme should consider both the performance and practicality of the scheme.},

[Subjects] The subjects were 51 athletes from Unicaja athletic club who trained regularly. [Methods] At the end of the preseason and volume periods, athletes were subjected to bipodal and monopodal stabilometry. In addition, all injuries happening in the periods after performing stabilometry (volume and pre-competition periods) were tracked. [Results] Variance analysis of bipodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the preseason period showed that athletes with higher values for the center-of-pressure spread variables suffered injuries during the volume period. The right-leg monopodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the volume period showed that athletes with higher values in the center-of-pressure position variables suffered injuries during the pre-competition period. [Conclusion] Athletes showing the worst values for center-of-pressure spread variables are more prone to sports injuries in the subsequent training period. In monopodal measurements, athletes with poorer mediolateral stability were more prone to injuries in the subsequent training period.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES There have been recent calls for the application of the complex systems approach in sports injury research. However, beyond theoretical description and static models of complexity, little progress has been made towards formalising this approach in way that is practical to sports injury scientists and clinicians. Therefore, our objective was to use a computational modelling method and develop a dynamic simulation in sports injury research. METHODS Agent-based modelling (ABM) was used to model the occurrence of sports injury in a synthetic athlete population. The ABM was developed based on sports injury causal frameworks and was applied in the context of distance running-related injury (RRI). Using the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR), we simulated the dynamic relationship between changes in weekly running distance and RRI through the manipulation of various 'athlete management tools'. RESULTS The findings confirmed that building weekly running distances over time, even within the reported ACWR 'sweet spot', will eventually result in RRI as athletes reach and surpass their individual physical workload limits. Introducing training-related error into the simulation and the modelling of a 'hard ceiling' dynamic resulted in a higher RRI incidence proportion across the population at higher absolute workloads. CONCLUSIONS The presented simulation offers a practical starting point to further apply more sophisticated computational models that can account for the complex nature of sports injury aetiology. Alongside traditional forms of scientific inquiry, the use of ABM and other simulation-based techniques could be considered as a complementary and alternative methodological approach in sports injury research.},

Results from the FIVB Volleyball Injury Study were used to compare two different recording methods. The aim of this paper was to provide recommendations on how standardised methodology can be developed to quantify overuse injuries in surveillance studies. Using beach volleyball data, a "traditional" cohort study approach using a time-loss injury definition suggested that injury risk was very low. In contrast, the data from a survey of past and present pain problems in the shoulder, knees and low back demonstrated that these were prevalent. The following recommendations are made: (1) studies should be prospective, with continuous or serial measurements of symptoms; (2) valid and sensitive scoring instruments need to be developed to measure pain and other relevant symptoms; (3) prevalence and not incidence should be used to report injury risk; (4) severity should be measured based on functional level and not time loss from sports. In conclusion, new approaches are needed to develop more appropriate methodology to quantify overuse injuries in studies.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine variations in neuromuscular and hormonal status and their relationship to performance throughout a season of elite Australian Rules Football (ARF). Methods: Fifteen elite ARF players performed a single jump (CMJ1) and 5 repeated countermovement jumps (CMJ5), and provided saliva samples for the analysis of cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) before the season commenced (Pre) and during the 22-match season. Magnitudes of effects were reported with the effect size (ES) statistic. Correlations were performed to analyze relationships between assessment variables and match time, training load, and performance. Results: CMJ1Flight time:Contraction time was substantially reduced on 60{\%} of measurement occasions. Magnitudes of change compared with Pre ranged from 1.0 ± 7.4{\%} (ES 0.04 ± 0.29) to -17.1 ± 21.8{\%} (ES -0.77 ± 0.81). Cortisol was substantially lower (up to -40 ± 14.1{\%}, ES of -2.17 ± 0.56) than Pre in all but one comparison. Testosterone response was varied, whereas T:C increased substantially on 70{\%} of occasions, with increases to 92.7 ± 27.8{\%} (ES 2.03 ± 0.76). CMJ1Flight time:Contraction time (r = .24 ± 0.13) and C displayed (r = -0.16 ± 0.1) small correlations with performance. Conclusion: The response of CMJ1Flight time:Contraction time suggests periods of neuromuscular fatigue. Change in T:C indicates subjects were unlikely to have been in a catabolic state during the season. Increase in C compared with Pre had a small negative correlation with performance. Both CMJ1Flight time:Contraction time and C may be useful variables for monitoring responses to training and competition in elite ARF athletes. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

METHODS AND MEASURES Prior to the 2011 football (soccer) season, the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral YBT reach distances and limb lengths of 74 soccer players were measured. Athletes' physiotherapists documented how many days the players were unable to play due to the injuries. After normalizing for lower limb length, each of the reach distances, right/left reach distance difference and composite reach distance were examined using odds ratios and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Logistic regression models indicated that players with a difference of equal or greater than 4cm between lower limbs in posteromedial direction were 3.86 more likely to sustain a lower extremity injury (p=0.001). Results indicate that players who had lower scores than the mean in each reach direction, independently, were almost two times more likely to sustain an injury. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that YBT can be incorporated into physical examinations to identify soccer players who are susceptible to risk of injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 2b.},

abstract = {Wang H-K, Chen C-H, Shiang T-Y, Jan M-H, Lin K-H. Risk-factor analysis of high school basketball-player ankle injuries: a prospective controlled cohort study evaluating postural sway, ankle strength, and flexibility. Objective: To analyze risk factors, including postural sway, ankle strength, and flexibility, for the prediction of ankle injuries in men's high school basketball players. Design: A cohort study with follow-up duration of 1 basketball season. Setting: Biomechanics laboratory. Participants: Forty-two (age, 16.5±1.1y) players competing in first league of the High School Basketball Association without history of injury in the lower extremities within 6 months before recruitment and without significant malalignment in the lower extremities were included. None of these players met exclusion criteria such as using ankle braces or taping or failed in wearing low-top sports shoes during the follow-up season. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Biomechanic measurements including isokinetic ankle strength, 1-leg standing postural sway, and ankle joint dorsiflexion flexibility were performed before the basketball season by 1 physical therapist. The subsequent monthly follow-up questionnaires were sent and returned by mail to prospectively record the incidence of ankle injury occurring in the season. Results of these preseason measurements were analyzed to correlate if any of these measured variables could predict future ankle injuries. Results: Eighteen ankle sport injuries were recorded for 42 players during the follow-up season. High variation of postural sway in both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions corresponded to occurrences of ankle injuries (P=.01, odds ratio [OR]=1.220; P{\textless}.001, OR=1.216, respectively). All other variables were not associated with injury. Conclusions: High variations of postural sway in 1-leg standing test could explain partly the increased prevalence of ankle injury in basketball players. It may be used as a screening tool to recommend balance training before basketball season. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Most existing methods for mediation analysis assume that mediation is a stationary, time-invariant process, which overlooks the inherently dynamic nature of many human psychological processes and behavioral activities. In this article, we consider mediation as a dynamic process that continuously changes over time. We propose Bayesian multilevel time-varying coefficient models to describe and estimate such dynamic mediation effects. By taking the nonparametric penalized spline approach, the proposed method is flexible and able to accommodate any shape of the relationship between time and mediation effects. Simulation studies show that the proposed method works well and faithfully reflects the true nature of the mediation process. By modeling mediation effect nonparametrically as a continuous function of time, our method provides a valuable tool to help researchers obtain a more complete understanding of the dynamic nature of the mediation process underlying psychological and behavioral phenomena. We also briefly discuss an alternative approach of using dynamic autoregressive mediation model to estimate the dynamic mediation effect. The computer code is provided to implement the proposed Bayesian dynamic mediation analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record},

abstract = {There is a significant risk of injury when undertaking physical activities. Abnormal biomechanics of the lower limb has been implicated as a causative factor for injury. Although there have been a large number of studies in this field, many lack consistency of definitions and methodology. A large number of these studies have been retrospective, and it is often impossible to identify the baseline population. The evidence suggests that limitation of range of ankle dorsiflexion, limitation of range of hip eversion, excessive joint laxity, leg length discrepancy, an excessively supinated or pronated foot, excessively high or low arches of the foot and a large Q-angle are risk factors for injury. On the other hand, there is little convincing evidence that an abnormal range of ankle plantar flexion, genu varum or valgum or undue muscle tightness may be potential risk factors. All of these biomechanical abnormalities need further evaluation as potential risk factors for injury. Any trials undertaken must endeavour to define and describe their methods fully, and ensure that their results are reproducible.},

abstract = {Traditional methods employed to study musculoskeletal injury mechanisms and joint biomechanics utilise in vivo or in vitro techniques. The advent of new technology and improved methods has also given rise to in silico (computer modelling) techniques. Under the current research paradigm, in vivo, in vitro and in silico methods independently provide information regarding the mechanisms and prevention of musculoskeletal injury. However, individually, each of these methods has multiple, inherent limitations and is likely to provide incomplete answers about multifactorial, complex injury conditions. The purpose of this treatise is to review current methods used to study, understand, and prevent musculoskeletal injury and to develop new conceptual-methodological frameworks that may help create a paradigm shift in musculoskeletal injury prevention research. We term the fusion of these three techniques in simulacra amalgama, or simply in sim, meaning a "union of models done on the likeness of phenomena." Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury will be employed as a model example for the utility and applicability of the proposed, synthesised approach. Shifting the current experimental paradigm to incorporate a multifaceted, multidisciplinary, integration of in vivo, in vitro and in silico methods into the proposed in sim approaches may provide a platform for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between complex joint biomechanics and observed injury mechanisms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 {\textcopyright} 2015 Informa UK Ltd. Work stress is common and can lead to various bodily dysfunctions. The Allostatic Load Index (ALI) is a tool to measure the wear and tear of the body caused by chronic stress. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the association of work-related stress and ALI in German industrial employees. A short form ALI should be developed for practical use of company physicians. In this exploration of an industrial cohort (n = 3797; 79.3{\%} male), work stress was measured by the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) questionnaire in 2009-2011. ALI was calculated using 15 variables including anthropometric data, heart rate variability, as well as blood and urine samples based on predefined subclinical cut-off values. Differences in ALI related to low (≤1) and high ( {\textgreater} 1) ERI categories were tested. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between ALI and work stress controlling for multiple confounders. Employees exposed to high work stress showed higher ALI scores (p {\textless} 0.001) compared to those with low stress levels. In multivariable models, ALI was associated with work stress (OR 1.19 [95{\%} CI: 1.00, 1.42]; p {\textless} 0.05) following adjustment for a range of potential confounders. By reducing ALI parameters to five variables this association increased modestly and remained statistically significant (OR 1.27 [95{\%} CI: 1.05, 1.54]; p {\textless} 0.05). The results indicate that work stress is associated with ALI in German industrial employees. A short form index seems to be a promising approach for occupational health practitioners. The results should be validated in further longitudinal explorations defining a standard set of variables including gender-related thresholds.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The primary purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) to root mean square of successive normal-to-normal interval differences (RMSSD) ratio from 1-min recordings (SDNN:RMSSD1-min) compared to criterion recordings, as well as its relationship to low-frequency-to-high-frequency ratio (LF:HF) at rest and following maximal exercise in a group of collegiate athletes. METHOD Twenty athletes participated in the study. Heart rate variability (HRV) data were measured for 5 min before and at 5-10 and 25-30 min following a maximal exercise test. From each 5-min segment, the frequency-domain measures of HF, LF, and LF:HF ratio were analyzed. Time-domain measures of SDNN, RMSSD, and SDNN:RMSSD ratio were also analyzed from each 5-min segment, as well as from randomly selected 1-min recordings. RESULT The 1-min values of SDNN, RMSSD, and SDNN:RMSSD provided no significant differences and nearly perfect intra-class correlations (ICCs ranged from 0.97 to 1.00, p {\textless} 0.001 for all) to the criterion measures from 5-min recordings. In addition, SDNN, RMSSD, and SDNN:RMSSD from the 1-min segments provided very large to nearly perfect correlations (r values ranged from 0.71 to 0.97, p {\textless} 0.001 for all) to LF, HF, and LF:HF, respectively, at each time point. CONCLUSION The findings of the study suggest that ultra-shortened time-domain markers may be useful surrogates of the frequency-domain parameters for tracking changes in sympathovagal activity in athletes.},

Little is known about the ways in which moderator variables may interact with one another to increase vulnerability or resilience. We propose a distinction between conjunctive moderation, in which multiple moderators must co-occur in a specific combination or pattern to maximize a relation between a predictor and an outcome variable, and disjunctive moderation, in which any one of a number of moderators maximizes the predictor-criterion relation. Our results indicate that social support and psychological coping skills are statistically independent psychosocial resources and that they operate in a conjunctive manner to influence the relation between life stress and subsequent athletic injury in adolescents. Only athletes low in both coping skills and social support exhibited a significant stress-injury relation, and in that vulnerable subgroup, negative major life events accounted for up to 30{\%} of the injury variance.

The narrative is divided into three main sections: (1) conceptual and definitional issues, (2) theoretical and empirical issues, and (3) implications for applied practice. The review focuses on the environmental stressors that coaches encounter, their appraisals of and responses to these demands, and the impact this has on their personal well-being and job performance. The influence of various personal and situational characteristics is also discussed. A key message to emerge from this review is that the potential health and performance costs of psychological stress to sports coaches are significant. The rapid rate of change in contemporary sport and the dynamic nature of stress mean that stress in coaches is an ongoing problem that needs to be monitored and addressed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {The extraction of regulatory networks and pathways from postgenomic data is important for drug ­discovery and development, as the extracted pathways reveal how genes or proteins regulate each other. Following up on the seminal paper of Friedman et al. (J Comput Biol 7:601–620, 2000), Bayesian networks have been widely applied as a popular tool to this end in systems biology research. Their popularity stems from the tractability of the marginal likelihood of the network structure, which is a consistent scoring scheme in the Bayesian context. This score is based on an integration over the entire parameter space, for which highly expensive computational procedures have to be applied when using more complex ­models based on differential equations; for example, see (Bioinformatics 24:833–839, 2008). This chapter gives an introduction to reverse engineering regulatory networks and pathways with Gaussian Bayesian networks, that is Bayesian networks with the probabilistic BGe scoring metric [see (Geiger and Heckerman 235–243, 1995)]. In the BGe model, the data are assumed to stem from a Gaussian distribution and a normal-Wishart prior is assigned to the unknown parameters. Gaussian Bayesian network methodology for analysing static observational, static interventional as well as dynamic (observational) time series data will be described in detail in this chapter. Finally, we apply these Bayesian network inference methods (1) to observational and interventional flow cytometry (protein) data from the well-known RAF pathway to evaluate the global network reconstruction accuracy of Bayesian network inference and (2) to dynamic gene expression time series data of nine circadian genes in Arabidopsis thaliana to reverse engineer the unknown regulatory network topology for this domain.},

We aim to investigate the associations between HRV High Frequency (HF) and Low Frequency (LF) powers and work stress in a sample of 36 healthy nurses. Perceived work stress was assessed twice one year apart, using the Job Content and Effort Reward Imbalance questionnaires. This allows to classify nurses in three exposure groups: “prolonged high stress” (PHS), “recent high stress” (RHS) and “stable low stress” (SLS). A 24-h ECG monitoring was later performed during a working day (WD) and a subsequent resting day (RD). Statistically significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.02) HF and LF means were found in PHS and RHS nurses during the working periods. In the subsequent resting periods, HF means showed increases over time in the RHS (beta = +0.41, p {\textless} 0.05), but not in PHS nurses. LF means did not show any substantial increases in the resting periods, in the PHS group with geometric means lower when compared to SLS, in the non-working and resting periods. Our study evidences that both prolonged and recent perceived high work stress were associated with a reduction of HF and LF powers during work. In addition, prolonged stress was associated with a lack of recovery during not-working and resting periods.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between several parameters of neuromuscular performance with dynamic postural control using a Bayesian Network Classifiers (BN) based analysis. Methods The y-balance test (measure of dynamic postural control), isokinetic (concentric and eccentric) knee flexion and extension strength, isometric hip abduction and adduction strength, lower extremity joint range of motion (ROM) and core stability were assessed in 44 elite male futsal players. A feature selection process was carried out before building a BN (using the Tabu search algorithm) for each leg. The BN models built were used to make belief updating processes to study the individual and concurrent contributions of the selected parameters of neuromuscular performance on dynamic postural control. Results The BNs generated using the selected features by the algorithms correlation attribute evaluator and chi squared reported the highest evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) for the dominant (AUC = 0.899) and non-dominant (AUC = 0.879) legs, respectively. Conclusions The BNs demonstrated that performance achieved in the y-balance test appears to be widely influenced by hip and knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion ROM measures in the sagittal plane, as well as by measures of static but mainly dynamic core stability in the frontal plane. Therefore, training interventions aimed at improving or maintaining dynamic postural control in elite male futsal players should include, among other things, exercises that produce ROM scores equal or higher than 127 of hip flexion, 132.5 of knee flexion as well as 34 and 30.5 of ankle dorsiflexion with the knee flexed and extended, respectively. Likewise, these training interventions should also include exercises to maintain or improve both the static and dynamic (medial-lateral plane) core stability so that futsal players can achieve medial radial error values lower than 6.69 and 8.79 mm, respectively.},

abstract = {Objectives: To examine (a) the relationships between the psychosocial risk factors and injury rates and (b) the effects of psychological-based prevention interventions on the injury risk of soccer players. Design: Scholarly electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus) were searched on 1 January 2017, complemented by manual searches of bibliographies. Setting: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Participants: We identified 13 eligible studies, including a total of 1149 injured soccer players aged between 14 and 36 years. Main outcome measures: Psychosocial risk factors, psychological-based prevention interventions and injury risk in soccer players. Results: Personality traits, such as trait anxiety and perceived mastery climate, along with a history of stressors, like negative-life-event stress or high level of life stress, daily hassle, and previous injury, are the main predictors of injury rates among soccer players. Also, from injury prevention studies, it has been shown that psychological-based interventions reduce injury rates (effect size = 0.96; 95{\%} CI 0.34–1.58; p = 0.002) in senior soccer players. Conclusions: Practitioners need to ensure injured soccer players are psychologically and socially ready to play. They should also employ psychological-based interventions (i.e., mindfulness, imagery, self-talk, stress management, relaxation, goal setting) when designing injury prevention programs.},

abstract = {Purpose: To use a novel, non-invasive hand held device (MyotonPRO) to quantify ratios of relative non-neural tone and mechanical properties of the rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles, and to assess reliability of a novice user. Relevance: The device offers rapid, objective testing of mechanical parameters of muscle in clinical or sports settings. Participants: 21 healthy males (20-35 years) Methods: Relaxed muscle parameters of RF and BFwere obtained using the MyotonPRO. The device applies a brief mechanical impact, producing muscle oscillations from which tone (state of intrinsic tension, indicated by frequency [Hz]) and mechanical properties of elasticity (logarithmic decrement) and stiffness (N/m) are measured. Data were collected on two days, one week apart. Two series of 10 single measurements on each muscle were used to test within-day reliability. The mean of the two sets was used for between-day reliability.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n $\backslash$r$\backslash$nAnalysis: The relative parameters between RF and BF were expressed as a ratio. Reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs).$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults: The mean (±SD) RF:BF ratios for resting muscle were: frequency 1:0.96 (±0.05), decrement 1:1.10 (±0.17) and stiffness 1:0.95 (±0.07). Reliability of all three parameters was excellent within-sessions (ICCs 3,2 {\textgreater}0.99) and good between-days (ICCs 3,1 0.72-0.87). Conclusions: The relative resting tone and mechanical properties of RF and BF has been characterised in young males, with ratios close to 1:1. Measures made by a novice user were reliable, indicating that the MyotonPRO has the potential for assessing changes in muscle properties objectively over time. Studies are needed in large healthy cohorts of different ages, activity levels and genders to produce reference data for assessing patients. Implications: The relative tone and mechanical properties of RF and BF could potentially be used as a rapid method for assessing risk of injury is sporting populations and presence of abnormality in musculoskeletal and neurological conditions, once normal values have been established in relevant groups.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a relevant marker reflecting cardiac modulation by sympathetic and vagal components of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Although the clinical application of HRV is mainly associated with the prediction of sudden cardiac death and assessing cardiovascular and metabolic illness progression, recent observations have suggested its applicability to physical exercise training. HRV is becoming one of the most useful tools for tracking the time course of training adaptation/maladaptation of athletes and in setting the optimal training loads leading to improved performances. However, little is known regarding the role of HRV and the internal effects of physical exercise on an athlete, which may be useful in designing fitness programs ensuring sufficient training load that may correspond with the specific ability of the athlete. In this review, we offer a comprehensive assessment of investigations concerning the interrelation between HRV and ANS, and examine how the application of HRV to physical exercise may play a role in sports physiology.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential relationship between life events and injury among high school football players. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a prospective cohort study. We collected athlete-exposure and injury data through 2 consecutive seasons at 13 high schools. Injury data consisted of injury status, frequency, severity, practice versus game, time of season, and total time lost from football participation. A life event survey was administered at the end of each season to obtain total, negative, and positive life event scores. SUBJECTS: A total of 331 varsity high school football players. MEASUREMENTS: Data collected included athlete exposures, injury reports, and life event surveys. Statistical analysis was completed using the Wilcoxon rank sum W test, the Pearson chi(2) test using an iterative proportional fitting procedure, and contingency chi(2) test. RESULTS: Total and negative life change measures significantly affected injury status and frequency of injury (P {\textless}.05). However, they did not reflect differences in severity of injury or time lost due to injury, and the positive life change measure was not associated with significant differences for any injury factor (P {\textgreater}.05). Preseason injury rates were significantly higher than season and playoff injury rates (P {\textless}.05). CONCLUSIONS: High school football players who experience high degrees of total and negative change were at greater risk of becoming injured and of sustaining multiple injuries. Playing situation and time of season also affected risk of injury.},

abstract = {The influence of psychological factors on sports injuries has been demonstrated in numerous empirical studies. Almost all investigations have been based on stress theory or a personality-profile approach. Although the majority of studies have employed different methods, the results are in general agreement that "life events" can influence the risk of injury in athletes. In this context, social support appears to have a buffering effect. According to existing results, the influence of stress-coping strategies is somewhat questionable. From the numerous psychological attributes that have been investigated in relation to sports injuries, only competitive anxiety has been shown to be associated with injury occurrence. A personality profile typical of the "injury-prone" athlete does not exist. However, several studies have shown a certain readiness to take risks (lack of caution, adventurous spirit) on the part of injured athletes. In this review, the current knowledge regarding the relationship between psychological factors and sports injuries is presented and a stress theory model is developed.},

abstract = {Postural control is an adaptive process that can be affected by many aspects of human behavior, including emotional contexts. The main emotional contexts that affect postural control are postural threat and passive viewing of aversive or threatening images, both of which produce a reduction in postural sway. The aim of the present study was to assess whether similar stress-related changes in postural sway can be observed using stress induced by social evaluative threat (SET) while perform-ing arithmetic tasks. Twelve young adults performed an arithmetic and a postural control task separately, concurrently, and concurrently with added time pressure in the arithmetic task. In the final condition, participants were given negative feedback about their performance in the arithmetic task and performed it again while being observed (SET condition). Results showed that stress increased linearly with task demand. Postural sway and reaction times were not affected by the first two conditions; however, when time pressure was introduced, reaction times became faster and sway amplitude increased. Finally, introduc-tion of SET caused the predicted reduction in postural sway and an increase in reaction times relative to the time pressure condition. Our results suggest that stress induced using a combination of arithmetic tasks and social evaluative threat leads to systematic changes in postural control. The paradigm developed in the present study would be very useful in assessing interactions between cognition, stress, and postural control in the context of postural instability and falls in older adults.},

abstract = {In terms of cardiovascular, endocrine and immune responses, acute high-intensity aerobic exercise stress may be considered as a subcategory of stressful active coping. The cardiorespiratory responses of both include increases in heart rate, cardiac output, systolic blood pressure, skeletal muscle vasodilation and oxygen consumption. Neurohormonal responses include increases in catecholamines as well as elevations in cortisol under high but relatively low sympathetic activation. Immune system responses include increases in natural killer (NK) cell number and cytotoxicity and suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes as well as decreased proliferative response to mitogens. Task and recovery periods for both acute psychological stress or exercise show biphasic changes in immune response such that immune status is negatively impacted during recovery. Chronic life stressors influence acute cardiovascular, endocrine and immune responses to acute stressors. In addition, both chronic stress and unusually heavy chronic exercise can negatively impact immune status. Given impaired immune status following chronic stress and interactive effects of acute and chronic stressors (e.g. blunted acute NK responses to acute stressors), it is suggested that these factors may extend the window of vulnerability for infectious agents to act following acute psychological (e.g. examinations) or strenuous exercise (competitive athletics) stressors.},

abstract = {Objective-Much of the research on sports- and recreation-related injuries focuses on a specific population, activity, or type of injury, and national estimates of the total burden of sports- and recreation-related injuries are limited. This study provides national estimates of the injury burden and examines the distribution of sports- and recreation-related injuries across demographic groups, activities, and injury circumstances. Methods-Information on medically attended injury episodes for persons aged 5 years and over were obtained from the 2011-2014 National Health Interview Survey. Sports- and recreation-related injuries are categorized by the associated activity using a classification scheme based on the International Classification of External Causes of Injury. Results-An average annual estimate of 8.6 million sports- and recreation-related injury episodes was reported, with an age-adjusted rate of 34.1 per 1,000 population. Males (61.3{\%}) and persons aged 5-24 years (64.9{\%}) accounted for more than one-half of injury episodes. Injury rates were higher among males, children aged 5-14 years, and non-Hispanic white persons than for their counterparts. One-half of the sports- and recreation-related injury episodes (50.0{\%}) resulted in treatment at a doctor's office or other health clinic without an emergency department visit or hospitalization. Overall, general exercise was the most frequently mentioned activity associated with sports- and recreation-related injuries, but types of activities varied across sex and age groups. Body regions injured while engaging in sports and recreation activities included the lower extremity (42.0{\%}), upper extremity (30.3{\%}), and head and neck (16.4{\%}). Conclusion-As the nation continues to recognize the importance of physical activity to maintain health, more research efforts are needed to examine sport and recreation injury across various activities, demographic groups, and health care settings, especially settings other than emergency departments and hospitals.},

Variability of each measurement, as well as covariability between pairs of measurements, was partitioned into among- and within-snail (i.e., measurement error) components. The {\%}ME varied by two orders of magnitude across the ten measurement variables considered. Shell weight had the lowest {\%}ME (0.059{\%}), while body whorl height had the highest (3.88{\%}). There was a low correlation between {\%}ME and the among-snail coefficient of variation for each variable (r = —0.28; P {\textgreater} 0.20). Within-snail correlations between pairs of measurement variables were uniformly low (rwithin {\textless} 0.20), while among-snail correlations were generally very high (r = 0.74 to 0.99) due to the large size range of snails in the sample.

abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters tu-e added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximum-likelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus.

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a popular tool for monitoring training adaptation and readiness in athletes, but it also has the potential to indicate early signs of somatic tissue overload prior to the onset of pain or fully developed injury. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between HRV, workloads, and risk of overuse problems in competitive Cross-Fit™ athletes. Daily resting HRV and workloads (duration × session-RPE) were recorded in six competitive CrossFit™ ath-letes across a 16 week period. The Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Overuse Injury Questionnaire was distributed weekly by e-mail. Acute-to-chronic workload ratios (ACWR) and the rolling 7-day average of the natural logarithm of the square root of the mean sum of the squared differences between R–R inter-vals (Ln rMSSDweek) were parsed into tertiles (low, moder-ate/normal, and high) based on within-individual z-scores. The interaction between Ln rMSSDweek and ACWR on overuse injury risk in the subsequent week was assessed using a general-ized linear mixed-effects model and magnitude-based infer-ences. The risk of overuse problems was substantially increased when a ‘low' Ln rMSSDweek was seen in combination with a ‘high' ACWR (relative risk [RR]: 2.61, 90{\%} CI: 1.38 – 4.93). In contrast, high ACWRs were well-tolerated when Ln rMSSDweek remained ‘normal' or was ‘high'. Monitoring HRV trends alongside workloads may provide useful information on an athlete's emerging global pattern to loading. HRV monitoring may therefore be used by practitioners to adjust and individual-ise training load prescriptions, in order to minimise overuse injury risk.

abstract = {The ability to maintain balance is critical for daily activities such as walking and fall avoidance. The contemporary models of postural control emphasize the central and somatic interactions engaged in maintaining balance; however, there is emerging evidence that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) - the sympathetic division, in particular - routinely participates in postural control. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence demonstrating the autonomic interactions in postural control. These interactions are presented in two broad categories: those that conceptualize the maintenance of postural equilibrium as a component of bodily homeostasis and those that illustrate how changes in affective states link cognitive perceptions and physiological responses (in this case, balance). The shared commonalities between postural and autonomic pathways are presented, pointing to the areas of overlap and the potential sources of the interaction. Although the specific function of autonomic engagement in postural control remains unknown, the potential roles are explored and highlight the directions for continued study.},

abstract = {Interactions between anxiety and vestibular symptoms have been described since the late 1800s. Typically, they have been conceptualized as bidirectional effects of one condition on the other (i.e., anxiety disorders as a cause of vestibular symptoms and vestibular disorders as a cause of anxiety symptoms). Over the past 30 years, however, a steady progression of neurophysiological investigations of gait and stance under conditions of postural threat, neuroanatomical studies of connections between threat assessment and vestibular pathways in the brain, and clinical research on anxiety-related vestibular conditions has offered the building blocks of a more integrated model. In this newer concept, threat assessment is an integral component of spatial perception, postural control, and locomotion in health and disease. It is not imposed on the vestibular system from the outside or simply reactive to vestibular dysfunction, but an inherently necessary part of every aspect of mobility. In this article, the authors review evidence that supports this model and then use it to examine common neurotologic conditions in which anxiety-related processes play important roles-fear of falling, primary and secondary anxiety disorders in patients with vestibular symptoms, and chronic subjective dizziness.},

abstract = {Background The MyotonPRO (Myoton Ltd; London) is a new portable device for measuring muscle mechanical properties (e.g. tone) and its reliability has yet to be established. Little is known about between-limb symmetry of mechanical properties in healthy older people, despite symmetry often being used as a measure of unilateral abnormalities in clinical assessment. Since quadriceps is important for mobility, it was selected for the present study. Aims To investigate: (i) between-day intra-rater reliability of a novice user of MyotonPRO; (ii) between-side symmetry of mechanical properties of quadriceps in older males. Methods Twenty healthy, community dwelling, right-lower-limb-dominant males (mean age 71.7, range 65–82 years) were studied. With the participant in relaxed supine lying, the MyotonPRO applied two consecutive sets of 10 taps to induce muscle oscillations of rectus femoris, from which measurements of decrement (elasticity), frequency (tone), and stiffness were obtained. Tests were performed on two occasions at the same time and day of the week, one week apart. Results Repeated measurements had very high within-day (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC 3,1{\textgreater}0.90) and high between-day (ICC 3,2{\textgreater}0.70; mean of two measurement sets) reliability. There was no statistically significant difference between muscle mechanical properties of the dominant and non-dominant muscles ({\textless}2.5{\%} difference; p{\textgreater}0.05), thereby indicating symmetry. Conclusions High intra-rater reliability was established for MyotonPRO measurements of quadriceps in healthy older males, which were symmetrical between sides. These findings indicate that larger studies are warranted to establish normal reference ranges of data with which to compare patients with muscle abnormalities.},

abstract = {The centre of pressure (COP) movement during stance maintenance on a stable surface is commonly used to describe and evaluate static balance. The aim of our study was to test sensitivity of individual COP parameters to different stance positions which were used to address size specific changes in the support surface. Twenty-nine subjects participated in the study. They carried out three 60-second repetitions of each of the five balance tasks (parallel stance, semi-tandem stance, tandem stance, contra-tandem stance, single leg stance). Using the force plate, the monitored parameters included the total COP distance, the distance covered in antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions, the maximum oscillation amplitude in antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions, the total frequency of oscillation, as well as the frequency of oscillation in antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions. The parameters which describe the total COP distance were the most sensitive to changes in the balance task, whereas the frequency of oscillation proved to be sensitive to a slightly lesser extent. Reductions in the support surface size in each of the directions resulted in proportional changes of antero-posterior and medio- lateral directions. The frequency of oscillation did not increase evenly with the increase in the level of difficulty of the balance task, but reached a certain value, above which it did not increase. Our study revealed the monitored parameters of the COP to be sensitive to the support surface size manipulations. The results of the study provide an important source for clinical and research use of the body sway measurements. Key pointsTesting static balance with body sway related center of pressure (COP) parameters;Testing sensitivity of COP sub-components to manipulations of the stance position;Analytical approach to the study of COP parameters that enable the insight to the frequency/amplitude and direction-dependency relationships;Adding to the basic knowledge of static balance which can be applied to testing and training routines.},

abstract = {The multitude of publications regarding overtraining syndrome (OTS or 'staleness') or the short-term 'over-reaching' and the severity of consequences for the athlete are in sharp contrast with the limited availability of valid diagnostic tools. Ergometric tests may reveal a decrement in sport-specific performance if they are maximal tests until exhaustion. Overtrained athletes usually present an impaired anaerobic lactacid performance and a reduced time-to-exhaustion in standardised high-intensity endurance exercise accompanied by a small decrease in the maximum heart rate. Lactate levels are also slightly lowered during submaximal performance and this results in a slightly increased anaerobic threshold. A reduced respiratory exchange ratio during exercise still deserves further investigation. A deterioration of the mood state and typical subjective complaints ('heavy legs', sleep disorders) represent sensitive markers, however, they may be manipulated. Although measurements at rest of selected blood markers such as urea, uric acid, ammonia, enzymes (creatine kinase activity) or hormones including the ratio between (free) serum testosterone and cortisol, may serve to reveal circumstances which, for the long term, impair the exercise performance, they are not useful in the diagnosis of established OTS. The nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion and the decrease in the maximum exercise-induced rise in pituitary hormones, especially adrenocorticotropic hormone and growth hormone, and, to a lesser degree, in cortisol and free plasma catecholamines, often provide interesting diagnostic information, but hormone measurements are less suitable in practical application. From a critical review of the existing overtraining research it must be concluded that there has been little improvement in recent years in the tools available for the diagnosis of OTS.},

Recent evidence from Pentilla and colleagues (2001) suggests that certain indices of HRV appear to be less affected by fluctuations in respiration, and may thus be a more robust indicator of parasympathetic (vagal) influence. In the present investigation, we sought to replicate and extend this report by exploring the relations between, impedance cardiography-derived respiration parameters (rate and amplitude) and time and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability in a multiethnic sample of healthy men and women (n=39; mean age = 20.33 +/- 3.47yrs). Preliminary results support Pentilla et al.'s finding that rMSSD is relatively free of respiratory influences (r = -.06 to .21; ns), and extends this work to a multiethnic sample. In conclusion, some measures of HRV appear to be relatively free of respiratory influences while others appear less so, independent of the subjects' ethnicity.},

abstract = {The stress system coordinates the adaptive responses of the organism to stressors of any kind.(1). The main components of the stress system are the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC/NE)-autonomic systems and their peripheral effectors, the pituitary-adrenal axis, and the limbs of the autonomic system. Activation of the stress system leads to behavioral and peripheral changes that improve the ability of the organism to adjust homeostasis and increase its chances for survival. The CRH and LC/NE systems stimulate arousal and attention, as well as the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, which is involved in anticipatory and reward phenomena, and the hypothalamic beta-endorphin system, which suppresses pain sensation and, hence, increases analgesia. CRH inhibits appetite and activates thermogenesis via the catecholaminergic system. Also, reciprocal interactions exist between the amygdala and the hippocampus and the stress system, which stimulates these elements and is regulated by them. CRH plays an important role in inhibiting GnRH secretion during stress, while, via somatostatin, it also inhibits GH, TRH and TSH secretion, suppressing, thus, the reproductive, growth and thyroid functions. Interestingly, all three of these functions receive and depend on positive catecholaminergic input. The end-hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, glucocorticoids, on the other hand, have multiple roles. They simultaneously inhibit the CRH, LC/NE and beta-endorphin systems and stimulate the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and the CRH peptidergic central nucleus of the amygdala. In addition, they directly inhibit pituitary gonadotropin, GH and TSH secretion, render the target tissues of sex steroids and growth factors resistant to these substances and suppress the 5' deiodinase, which converts the relatively inactive tetraiodothyronine (T(4)) to triiodothyronine (T(3)), contributing further to the suppression of reproductive, growth and thyroid functions. They also have direct as well as insulin-mediated effects on adipose tissue, ultimately promoting visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension (metabolic syndrome X) and direct effects on the bone, causing "low turnover" osteoporosis. Central CRH, via glucocorticoids and catecholamines, inhibits the inflammatory reaction, while directly secreted by peripheral nerves CRH stimulates local inflammation (immune CRH). CRH antagonists may be useful in human pathologic states, such as melancholic depression and chronic anxiety, associated with chronic hyperactivity of the stress system, along with predictable behavioral, neuroendocrine, metabolic and immune changes, based on the interrelations outlined above. Conversely, potentiators of CRH secretion/action may be useful to treat atypical depression, postpartum depression and the fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndromes, all characterized by low HPA axis and LC/NE activity, fatigue, depressive symptomatology, hyperalgesia and increased immune/inflammatory responses to stimuli.},

The asymptomatic side of the AT group was used as a control (control group 1). Measurements at 2 cm intervals on the tendon from its insertion at the calcaneum up to the musculotendinous junction were taken non-weight bearing (NWB) and weight bearing (WB) using the MyotonPRO.Results There was a significant (p{\&}lt;0.005) decrease in natural oscillation frequency (F) at points 2, 3 and 4 of the AT group (NWB condition) and points 2 and 3 for the WB condition. There was a significant (p{\&}lt;0.005) increase in logarithmic decrement (D) at points 2 and 3 signifying a decrease in elasticity. Dynamic stiffness (S) was significantly (p{\&}lt;0.005) reduced in the AT group at points 2 and 3 WB and point 3 WB. There was no significant difference in creep (C) observed between the symptomatic and asymptomatic tendons. There was a significant (p{\&}lt;0.005) increase in mechanical stress relaxation time (R) at point 2 NWB.There was a correlation between body weight and gender on tendon mechanics, with the symptomatic tendons. No significant differences were observed between the control group 1 and control group 2.Conclusions The MyotonPRO measured decreased stiffness over a section of the tendon corresponding clinically with Achilles tendinopathy. This may have potential in identifying risk of injury and informing rehabilitation, however further extensive research is required to generate baseline data for specific population groups monitoring variables over time. Age, gender and body mass index appear to have some bearing on the mechanical properties of the tendon but mainly in the tendinopathy group.},

The findings from Team One indicated that players who incurred a significant time-loss injury had experienced greater negative--but not positive--life changes in the previous twelve months than noninjured players. Further, injured players tended to have higher object loss scores than noninjured players. No between-group differences were found for Team Two. Trait anxiety, competitive trait anxiety, and locus of control were examined as possible moderator variables in the life change--injury relationship, and were found to have no significant effects.

abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters tu-e added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximum-likelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus. The real-data analyses use data from Holzinger and Swineford's (1939) classic mental abilities study, Big Five personality factor data from a British survey, and science achievement data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether perceived muscular tension, psychological demands and emotional stress were associated with physical load or working technique during visual display unit (VDU) work. METHODS: Subjects (28 women and 29 men) from two different organisations volunteered to participate in the study. The study design was cross-sectional, and the data were assessed when the subjects performed their usual work tasks at their usual work place. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate possible associations. The different outcome variables were: median muscle activity and muscular rest in the trapezius muscle bilaterally, wrist movements and working technique. The different explanatory variables were: perceived muscular tension (binary), emotional stress (binary), psychological demands (binary), organisation (binary) and gender (binary). Age (continuous) and present musculoskeletal pain (binary) were also controlled for in the multivariate models. Electromyography (EMG) and electrogoniometers were used to assess the physical load, and the data collection time was 15 min. An ergonomic checklist was used to assess working technique, i.e. work with lifted shoulders. RESULTS: Subjects who perceived muscular tension at least a few times per week the month before the measurements were made worked with higher muscle activity [expressed as per cent of a reference voluntary electrical activity ({\%} RVE)] in the trapezius muscle bilaterally (5{\%} RVE, P=0.05). High emotional stress during the measurement was associated with higher muscle activity in the trapezius muscle on the side not operating the computer mouse (8{\%} RVE, P=0.006). Subjects who reported high levels of emotional stress worked more often with lifted shoulders (odds ratio 6.0, 95{\%} CI 1.2-28.9). However, when present musculoskeletal pain was included in the multivariate model the odds ratio for high emotional stress decreased to 4.5 (95{\%} CI 0.9-23.2). CONCLUSIONS: Perceived muscular tension and emotional stress were associated with physical load, in terms of muscle activity in the trapezius muscles, during VDU work in ordinary occupational settings.},

abstract = {Background: Objective measurement of muscle tone and mechanical properties is generally challenging in clinical or sports settings and can be obtained using a novel hand-held device (MyotonPRO). Between-side comparison of muscle function and characteristics can assess abnormalities if normal symmetry is known, which this study investigated for biceps brachii (BB). Objectives: To examine between-side symmetry of mechanical muscle parameters and within-session intra-rater reliability of testing the BB muscle. Design: Methodological, observational, intra-rater reliability study. Participants: Convenience sample (n=21) of healthy males, aged 18-35 years. Methods: The participant lay supine with the elbow in slight flexion (10-15 degrees). The MyotonPRO applied brief, low force mechanical impulses over BB muscle belly eliciting damped oscillations, from which non-neural tone (frequency; Hz), dynamic stiffness [N/m] and elasticity (logarithmic decrement) were calculated automatically. Two sets of 10 impulses were applied bilaterally by a novice user. Actual, absolute and percentage differences between sides were calculated to assess symmetry. Within-session reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and Bland and Altman analysis. Results: Mean and standard deviation (±) absolute and percentage differences were 14±11N/m (6 ± 5{\%}) for stiffness 0.6 ± 0.4Hz (4 ± 3{\%}) for tone, and 0.08 ± 0.08 logarithmic decrement (7.5 ± 7{\%}) for elasticity. Within-session reliability was excellent for all three parameters (ICC3,2{\textgreater}0.95). The SEMs were 2.3N/m (stiffness), 0.1Hz (tone); and 0.03 for decrement (elasticity). Bland and Altman analysis showed minimal systematic bias between sets (d =-1.9N/m, -0.1Hz; and 0.05 decrement). Conclusions: Between-side symmetry was high for all three mechanical parameters of BB in healthy young males, with differ-ences of less than 10{\%}, and could be used for assessing abnormality. Reliability was excellent for all three parameters meas-ured within the same session. Robustness of repeating the testing protocol needs to be established between days, as well as reference values of symmetry produced for different muscles and cohorts.},

abstract = {PURPOSE/BACKGROUND Despite recent advances in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL) surgical techniques, an improved understanding of the ACL's biomechanical role, and expanding research on optimal rehabilitation practices in ACL-reconstructed (ACLR) patients, the re-tear rate remains alarmingly high and athletic performance deficits persist after completion of the rehabilitation course in a large percentage of patients. Significant deficits may persist in strength, muscular activation, power, postural stability, lower extremity mechanics, and psychological preparedness. Many patients may continue to demonstrate altered movement mechanics associated with increased injury risk. The purpose of this clinical commentary and literature review is to provide a summary of current evidence to assist the rehabilitation professional in recognizing, assessing, and addressing factors which may have been previously underappreciated or unrecognized as having significant influence on ACLR rehabilitation outcomes. METHODS A literature review was completed using PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Database with results limited to peer-reviewed articles published in English. 136 articles were reviewed and included in this commentary. CONCLUSIONS Barriers to successful return to previous level of activity following ACLR are multifactorial.Recent research suggests that changes to the neuromuscular system, movement mechanics, psychological preparedness, and motor learning deficits may be important considerations during late stage rehabilitation.

abstract = {The influence of psychological factors on sports injuries has been demonstrated in numerous empirical studies. Almost all investigations have been based on stress theory or a personality-profile approach. Although the majority of studies have employed different methods, the results are in general agreement that "life events" can influence the risk of injury in athletes. In this context, social support appears to have a buffering effect. According to existing results, the influence of stress-coping strategies is somewhat questionable. From the numerous psychological attributes that have been investigated in relation to sports injuries, only competitive anxiety has been shown to be associated with injury occurrence. A personality profile typical of the "injury-prone" athlete does not exist. However, several studies have shown a certain readiness to take risks (lack of caution, adventurous spirit) on the part of injured athletes. In this review, the current knowledge regarding the relationship between psychological factors and sports injuries is presented and a stress theory model is developed.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that anxiety and balance disorders could be related; however, the association between psychological processes and equilibrium remains ambiguous. In this study, we have examined whether mood states and anxiety may influence the ability to use the somatosensory, visual and vestibular systems and affect balance control in healthy subjects. Seven male students were submitted to a program testing equilibrium over a 12-day period, during which moods and anxiety states were assessed using self-evaluated questionnaires. Significant negative correlations were found between moods, including anxiety, and the subject's sensory and motor systems of balance control, suggesting that low moods may alter balance performance. However, depending on the type of mood, it is likely that adverse changes in mood states may affect balance in different ways, either through the sensory organization or motor control. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

@article{Garcia2013,
abstract = {One of the most promising non-invasive markers of the activity of the autonomic nervous system is heart rate variability (HRV). HRV analysis toolkits often provide spectral analysis techniques using the Fourier transform, which assumes that the heart rate series is stationary. To overcome this issue, the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is often used. However, the wavelet transform is thought to be a more suitable tool for analyzing non-stationary signals than the STFT. Given the lack of support for wavelet-based analysis in HRV toolkits, such analysis must be implemented by the researcher. This has made this technique underutilized. This paper presents a new algorithm to perform HRV power spectrum analysis based on the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (MODWPT). The algorithm calculates the power in any spectral band with a given tolerance for the band's boundaries. The MODWPT decomposition tree is pruned to avoid calculating unnecessary wavelet coefficients, thereby optimizing execution time. The center of energy shift correction is applied to achieve optimum alignment of the wavelet coefficients. This algorithm has been implemented in RHRV, an open-source package for HRV analysis. To the best of our knowledge, RHRV is the first HRV toolkit with support for wavelet-based spectral analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: An estimated 300,000 sport-related traumatic brain injuries, predominantly concussions, occur annually in the United States. Sports are second only to motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of traumatic brain injury among people aged 15 to 24 years. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of concussions in a nationally representative sample of high school athletes and to compare rates of concussion among high school and collegiate athletes. DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiologic study. SETTING: 100 United States high schools and 180 US colleges. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: United States high school and collegiate athletes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Data from 2 injury surveillance systems, High School Reporting Information Online (RIO) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance System, were analyzed to calculate rates, describe patterns, and evaluate potential risk factors for sport-related concussion. RESULTS: Concussions represented 8.9{\%} (n = 396) of all high school athletic injuries and 5.8{\%} (n = 482) of all collegiate athletic injuries. Among both groups, rates of concussions were highest in the sports of football and soccer. In high school sports played by both sexes, girls sustained a higher rate of concussions, and concussions represented a greater proportion of total injuries than in boys. In all sports, collegiate athletes had higher rates of concussion than high school athletes, but concussions represented a greater proportion of all injuries among high school athletes. CONCLUSIONS: Sport-related injury surveillance systems can provide scientific data to drive targeted injury-prevention projects. Developing effective sport-related concussion preventive measures depends upon increasing our knowledge of concussion rates, patterns, and risk factors.},

abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted interactions between state anxiety, sensory processing involved in motor performance, and personality traits such as trait anxiety. In the present study, we investigated the effects of moderate state anxiety on static balance performance with eyes open and eyes closed in two groups of healthy subjects with contrasting trait anxiety. We found that an anxiogenic condition induces larger and faster body swaying in both groups in the eyes-open test. This suggests that state anxiety could modify the processing of the different sensory inputs involved in balance control whatever the subjects' trait anxiety level. When vision is absent, precision of static balance control in individuals with intermediate level of trait anxiety - characterized by a higher visual dependence - is more disrupted than in low trait anxiety subjects. Moreover, moderate state anxiety seems to disturb the ability to use vestibular and/or somatosensory inputs in individuals with low anxiety, but not in individuals with intermediate trait anxiety. These results on inter-individual differences provide a first insight into the inter-dependence between trait anxiety, state anxiety and static balance control. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the empirical literature on psychological stress in sport, and the effects that such stress may have upon performance, vulnerability to injury, and rehabilitation from injury. It also examines the strategies that sports performers could use to overcome these effects. The major sources of stress that have been reported by sports performers include fear of failure, concerns about social evaluation by others (particularly the coach), lack of readiness to perform, and loss of internal control over one's environment. Various models and theories of the effects of such stress upon performance and vulnerability to injury are reviewed, including multidimensional anxiety theory and a catastrophe model of anxiety and performance. The cognitive and physiological processes which are thought to underly these effects are also reviewed, together with the intervention strategies that are implied by these processes. Research on the psychological stress that appears to be experienced by performers when they are injured is very limited. However, that which is available suggests that many of the same psychological skills that are thought to enhance performance can also be used to reduce the risk of injury, and promote a speedy recovery from injury. These include goal-setting, imagery, self-talk, and relaxation skills.},

abstract = {The brain is the key organ of the response to stress because it determines what is threatening and, therefore, potentially stressful, as well as the physiological and behavioral responses which can be either adaptive or damaging. Stress involves two-way communication between the brain and the cardiovascular, immune, and other systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms. Beyond the "flight-or-fight" response to acute stress, there are events in daily life that produce a type of chronic stress and lead over time to wear and tear on the body ("allostatic load"). Yet, hormones associated with stress protect the body in the short-run and promote adaptation ("allostasis"). The brain is a target of stress, and the hippocampus was the first brain region, besides the hypothalamus, to be recognized as a target of glucocorticoids. Stress and stress hormones produce both adaptive and maladaptive effects on this brain region throughout the life course. Early life events influence life-long patterns of emotionality and stress responsiveness and alter the rate of brain and body aging. The hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex undergo stress-induced structural remodeling, which alters behavioral and physiological responses. As an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapy, social and behavioral interventions such as regular physical activity and social support reduce the chronic stress burden and benefit brain and body health and resilience.},

abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) are increasingly being used to model environmental systems, in order to: integrate multiple issues and system components; utilise information from different sources; and handle missing data and uncertainty. BNs also have a modular architecture that facilitates iterative model development. For a model to be of value in generating and sharing knowledge or providing decision support, it must be built using good modelling practice. This paper provides guidelines to developing and evaluating Bayesian network models of environmental systems, and presents a case study habitat suitability model for juvenile Astacopsis gouldi, the giant freshwater crayfish of Tasmania. The guidelines entail clearly defining the model objectives and scope, and using a conceptual mode of the system to form the structure of the BN, which should be parsimonious yet capture all key components and processes. After the states and conditional probabilities of all variables are defined, the BN should be assessed by a suite of quantitative and qualitative forms of model evaluation. All the assumptions, uncertainties, descriptions and reasoning for each node and linkage, data and information sources, and evaluation results must be clearly documented. Following these standards will enable the modelling process and the model itself to be transparent, credible and robust, within its given limitations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objectives In order to investigate the applicability of routine 10s electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings for time-domain heart rate variability (HRV) calculation we explored to what extent these (ultra-)short recordings capture the “actual” HRV.   Methods The standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) were measured in 3,387 adults. SDNN and RMSSD were assessed from (ultra)short recordings of 10s(3x), 30s, and 120s and compared to 240s–300s (gold standard) measurements. Pearson's correlation coefficients (r), Bland-Altman 95{\%} limits of agreement and Cohen's d statistics were used as agreement analysis techniques.   Results Agreement between the separate 10s recordings and the 240s-300s recording was already substantial (r = 0.758–0.764/Bias = 0.398–0.416/d = 0.855–0.894 for SDNN; r = 0.853–0.862/Bias = 0.079–0.096/d = 0.150–0.171 for RMSSD), and improved further when three 10s periods were averaged (r = 0.863/Bias = 0.406/d = 0.874 for SDNN; r = 0.941/Bias = 0.088/d = 0.167 for RMSSD). Agreement increased with recording length and reached near perfect agreement at 120s (r = 0.956/Bias = 0.064/d = 0.137 for SDNN; r = 0.986/Bias = 0.014/d = 0.027 for RMSSD). For all recording lengths and agreement measures, RMSSD outperformed SDNN.   Conclusions Our results confirm that it is unnecessary to use recordings longer than 120s to obtain accurate measures of RMSSD and SDNN in the time domain. Even a single 10s (standard ECG) recording yields a valid RMSSD measurement, although an average over multiple 10s ECGs is preferable. For SDNN we would recommend either 30s or multiple 10s ECGs. Future research projects using time-domain HRV parameters, e.g. genetic epidemiological studies, could calculate HRV from (ultra-)short ECGs enabling such projects to be performed at a large scale.},

abstract = {Introduction: Training load and other measures potentially related to match performance are routinely monitored in team-sport athletes. The aim of this research was to examine the effect of training load on such measures and on match performance during a season of professional football. Materials and Methods: Training load was measured daily as session duration times perceived exertion in 23 A-league football players. Measures of exponentially weighted cumulative training load were calculated using decay factors representing time constants of 3 to 28 days. Players performed a countermovement jump for estimation of a measure of neuromuscular recovery (ratio of flight time to contraction time, FT:CT), and provided a saliva sample for measurement of testosterone and cortisol concentrations 1 d prior to each of 34 matches. Match performance was assessed via ratings provided by five coaching and fitness staff on a 5-point Likert scale. Effects of training load on FT:CT, hormone concentrations, and match performance were modeled as quadratic predictors and expressed as changes in the outcome measure for a change in the predictor of one within-player standard deviation (1 SD) below and above the mean. Changes in each of five playing positions were assessed using standardization and magnitude-based inference. Results: The largest effects of training were generally observed in the 3- to 14-d windows. Center defenders showed a small reduction in coach rating when 14-d smoothed load increased from -1 SD to the mean (-0.31, ±0.15; mean, ±90{\%} confidence limits), whereas strikers and wide midfielders displayed a small increase in coach rating when load increased 1 SD above the mean. The effects of training load on FT:CT were mostly unclear or trivial, but effects of training load on hormones included a large increase in cortisol (102, ±58 {\%}) and a moderate increase in testosterone (24, ±18 {\%}) in center defenders when 3-d smoothed training load increased 1 SD above the mean. A 1 SD increase in training load above the mean generally resulted in substantial reductions in testosterone:cortisol ratio. Conclusion: The effects of recent training on match performance and hormones in A-League football players highlight the importance of position-specific monitoring and training.},

abstract = {Time to stabilization (TTS) has been introduced as a method to analyze dynamic postural stability during jump and landing tasks, but has also been applied during the transition task from double-leg stance (DLS) to single-leg stance (SLS). However, the application of the originally described TTS technique during the latter task has some important limitations. The first goal of this study was to present an adapted version of the TTS technique to provide an effective alternative method to better analyze postural stability during the transition from DLS to SLS. The second goal was to study the influence of pathology and different speeds on postural stability outcomes. Fifteen healthy control subjects and 15 subjects with chronic ankle instability (CAI) performed the transition task on their preferred speed and as fast as possible, with eyes open and with eyes closed. Subjects with CAI performed the transition significantly slower when moving at their preferred speed with eyes closed. The time subjects needed to reach a new stability point was not discriminative between groups and largely dependent on movement speed. However, the amount of sway after this new stability point was significantly increased in the CAI group and when eyes were closed. The results of this study suggest that subjects with CAI have a decreased ability to overcome the postural perturbation created by the voluntary movement from DLS to SLS. Focusing only on TTS during the transition from DLS to SLS may lead at least in some cases to misinterpretations when assessing postural stability. ?? 2013.},

Because there have 5 been no reports on the TRESK expression or its function in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord 6 in neuropathic pain, we analyzed TRESK expression in the spinal dorsal horn in a spinal 7 nerve ligation(SNL) model. 8 Material and Methods: We established a SNL mouse model by using the L5-L6 spinal 9 nerves ligation. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry to 10 investigate TRESK expression in the dorsal horn and L5 dorsal rot ganglion(DRG). 11 Results: The SNL group showed significantly higher expression of TRESK in the ipsilateral 12 dorsal horn under pain but low expression in L5 DRG. Double immunofluorescence stainings 13 revealed that immunoreactivity of TRESK was almost restricted in neuronal cells. synapse 14 markers GAD67 and VGlut2 appeared to be associated with TRESK expression. We were 15 unable to find a significant association between TRESK and calcineurin by double 16 immunofluorescence. 17 Conclusion: TRESK in spinal cord neurons may contribute to the development of 18 neuropathic pain following injury.},

Nonetheless, a complete description of muscular factors influencing ROM among individuals and between men and women is lacking. We examined whether passive muscle stiffness (evaluated by angle-specific muscle shear modulus), tolerance to muscle stretch (evaluated by muscle shear modulus at end-ROM), and muscle slack angle of the triceps surae are associated with the individual variability and sex difference in dorsiflexion ROM, using ultrasound shear wave elastography. For men, ROM was negatively correlated to passive muscle stiffness of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius in a tensioned state and positively to tolerance to muscle stretch in the medial gastrocnemius. For women, ROM was only positively correlated to tolerance to muscle stretch in all muscles but not correlated to passive muscle stiffness. Muscle slack angle was not correlated to ROM in men and women. Significant sex differences were observed only for dorsiflexion ROM and passive muscle stiffness in a tensioned state. These findings suggest that muscular factors associated with ROM are different between men and women. Furthermore, the sex difference in dorsiflexion ROM might be attributed partly to that in passive muscle stiffness of plantar flexors.;},

Nineteen members of the Austrian track and field team (eleven males, eight females, 25.9 ± 3.9 years of age, 74.9 ± 20.1 kg, and 179.3 ± 10 cm) participated in this study. Data was collected during the European Games in Baku. Athletes delivered saliva samples at various time-points including morning samples and samples directly before and after the competition. Scoring points of the International Association of Athletics Federation were used as an individual measure of relative performance. We found that performance was negatively correlated with rise in testosterone concentrations in the last 24 h prior to the competition. A similar trend was found for cortisol levels, but only when the three least competitive athletes were removed from analysis. Pre-competition cortisol levels were significantly increased compared to measurements 24 h earlier. No effect of status on cortisol or testosterone increase in the same timeframe was found. We conclude that the tournament represented a stressor and that excessive endocrine response was associated with reduced performance.},

@article{VanMechelen1992,
abstract = {Notwithstanding the healthy influence of sporting activities on risk factors, in particular those of cardiovascular disease, it is becoming increasingly apparent that sports can present a danger to health in the form of sports injuries. The extent of the sports injury problem calls for preventative action based on the results of epidemiological research. For the interpretation of these facts uniform definitions are needed and limitations of research designs should be known. Measures to prevent sports injuries form part of what is called the 'sequence of prevention'. Firstly the extent of the sports injury problem must be identified and described. Secondly the factors and mechanisms which play a part in the occurrence of sports injuries have to be identified. The third step is to introduce measures that are likely to reduce the future risk and/or severity of sports injuries. This measure should be based on the aetiological factors and the mechanism as identified in the second step. Finally the effect of the measures must be evaluated by repeating the first step. In this review some aspects of the first and second step of the sequence of prevention are discussed. The extent of the sports injury problem is often described by injury incidence and by indicators of the severity of sports injuries. Sports injury incidence should preferably be expressed as the number of sports injuries per exposure time (e.g. per 1000 hours of sports participation) in order to facilitate the comparability of research results. However, one should realise that the outcome of research applying this definition of sports injury incidence is highly dependent on the definitions of 'sports injury' and 'sports participation'. The outcome of such research also depends on the applied research design and research methodology. The incidence of sports injuries depends on: the method used to count injuries (e.g. prospective vs retrospective); the method used to establish the population at risk; and on the representativeness of the sample. Severity of sports injuries can be described on the basis of 6 criteria: the nature of the sports injury; the duration and nature of treatment; sporting time lost; working time lost; permanent damage; and cost. Here also uniform definitions are important and necessary in order to enhance the comparability of research data. In the second step of the 'sequence of prevention' the aetiological factors that play a role in the occurrence of a sports injury have to be identified by epidemiological studies. Epidemiological research on the aetiology of sports injuries requires a conceptual model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The fascial system builds a three-dimensional continuum of soft, collagen-containing, loose and dense fibrous connective tissue that permeates the body and enables all body systems to operate in an integrated manner. Injuries to the fascial system cause a significant loss of performance in recreational exercise as well as high-performance sports, and could have a potential role in the development and perpetuation of musculoskeletal disorders, including lower back pain. Fascial tissues deserve more detailed attention in the field of sports medicine. A better understanding of their adaptation dynamics to mechanical loading as well as to biochemical conditions promises valuable improvements in terms of injury prevention, athletic performance and sports-related rehabilitation. This consensus statement reflects the state of knowledge regarding the role of fascial tissues in the discipline of sports medicine. It aims to (1) provide an overview of the contemporary state of knowledge regarding the fascial system from the microlevel (molecular and cellular responses) to the macrolevel (mechanical properties), (2) summarise the responses of the fascial system to altered loading (physical exercise), to injury and other physiological challenges including ageing, (3) outline the methods available to study the fascial system, and (4) highlight the contemporary view of interventions that target fascial tissue in sport and exercise medicine. Advancing this field will require a coordinated effort of researchers and clinicians combining mechanobiology, exercise physiology and improved assessment technologies.},

abstract = {Injuries have a great impact on professional soccer, due to their large influence on team performance and the considerable costs of rehabilitation for players. Existing studies in the literature provide just a preliminary understanding of which factors mostly affect injury risk, while an evaluation of the potential of statistical models in forecasting injuries is still missing. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional approach to injury forecasting in professional soccer that is based on GPS measurements and machine learning. By using GPS tracking technology, we collect data describing the training workload of players in a professional soccer club during a season. We then construct an injury forecaster and show that it is both accurate and interpretable by providing a set of case studies of interest to soccer practitioners. Our approach opens a novel perspective on injury prevention, providing a set of simple and practical rules for evaluating and interpreting the complex relations between injury risk and training performance in professional soccer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autonomic regulation of heart rate (HR) as an indicator of the body's ability to adapt to an exercise stimulus has been evaluated in many studies through HR variability (HRV) and post-exercise HR recovery (HRR). Recently, HR acceleration has also been investigated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of negative adaptations to endurance training (i.e., a period of overreaching leading to attenuated performance) and positive adaptations (i.e., training leading to improved performance) on autonomic HR regulation in endurance-trained athletes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, and Academic Search Premier databases from inception until April 2015. Included articles examined the effects of endurance training leading to increased or decreased exercise performance on four measures of autonomic HR regulation: resting and post-exercise HRV [vagal-related indices of the root-mean-square difference of successive normal R-R intervals (RMSSD), high frequency power (HFP) and the standard deviation of instantaneous beat-to-beat R-R interval variability (SD1) only], and post-exercise HRR and HR acceleration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 5377 records retrieved, 27 studies were included in the systematic review and 24 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Studies inducing increases in performance showed small increases in resting RMSSD [standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.58; P {\textless} 0.001], HFP (SMD = 0.55; P {\textless} 0.001) and SD1 (SMD = 0.23; P = 0.16), and moderate increases in post-exercise RMSSD (SMD = 0.60; P {\textless} 0.001), HFP (SMD = 0.90; P {\textless} 0.04), SD1 (SMD = 1.20; P = 0.04), and post-exercise HRR (SMD = 0.63; P = 0.002). A large increase in HR acceleration (SMD = 1.34) was found in the single study assessing this parameter. Studies inducing decreases in performance showed a small increase in resting RMSSD (SMD = 0.26; P = 0.01), but trivial changes in resting HFP (SMD = 0.04; P = 0.77) and SD1 (SMD = 0.04; P = 0.82). Post-exercise RMSSD (SMD = 0.64; P = 0.04) and HFP (SMD = 0.49; P = 0.18) were increased, as was HRR (SMD = 0.46; P {\textless} 0.001), while HR acceleration was decreased (SMD = -0.48; P {\textless} 0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Increases in vagal-related indices of resting and post-exercise HRV, post-exercise HRR, and HR acceleration are evident when positive adaptation to training has occurred, allowing for increases in performance. However, increases in post-exercise HRV and HRR also occur in response to overreaching, demonstrating that additional measures of training tolerance may be required to determine whether training-induced changes in these parameters are related to positive or negative adaptations. Resting HRV is largely unaffected by overreaching, although this may be the result of methodological issues that warrant further investigation. HR acceleration appears to decrease in response to overreaching training, and thus may be a potential indicator of training-induced fatigue.},

abstract = {Context: The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) is commonly used by researchers and clinicians to evaluate balance. A growing number of studies are using the BESS as an outcome measure beyond the scope of its original purpose. Objective: To provide an objective systematic review of the reliability and validity of the BESS. Data Sources: PubMed and CINHAL were searched using Balance Error Scoring System from January 1999 through December 2010. Study Selection: Selection was based on establishment of the reliability and validity of the BESS. Research articles were selected if they established reliability or validity (criterion related or construct) of the BESS, were written in English, and used the BESS as an outcome measure. Abstracts were not considered. Results: Reliability of the total BESS score and individual stances ranged from poor to moderate to good, depending on the type of reliability assessed. The BESS has criterion-related validity with force plate measures; more difficult stances have higher agreement than do easier ones. The BESS is valid to detect balance deficits where large differences exist (concussion or fatigue). It may not be valid when differences are more subtle. Conclusions: Overall, the BESS has moderate to good reliability to assess static balance. Low levels of reliability have been reported by some authors. The BESS correlates with other measures of balance using testing devices. The BESS can detect balance deficits in participants with concussion and fatigue. BESS scores increase with age and with ankle instability and external ankle bracing. BESS scores improve after training.},

Neuroscience research on human motivation in the workplace is still in its infancy. There is a large industrial and organizational (IO) psychology literature containing numerous theories of motivation, relating to prosocial and productive, and, less so, "darker" antisocial and counterproductive, behaviors. However, the development of a viable over-arching theoretical framework has proved elusive. In this chapter, we argue that basic neuropsychological systems related to approach, avoidance, and their conflict, may provide such a framework, one which we discuss in terms of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) of personality. We argue that workplace behaviors may be understood by reference to the motivational types that are formed from the combination of basic approach, avoidance, and conflict-related personalities. We offer suggestions for future research to explore workplace behaviors in terms of the wider literature on the neuroscience of motivation.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggested that the therapeutic effect of the antimammary cancer agent tamoxifen might be related to its metabolism. This study examined the cytochrome P-450 enzymes in rat and human liver catalyzing the metabolism of tamoxifen. Incubations of tamoxifen with rat liver microsomes yielded three major polar metabolites identified as the N-oxide, N-desmethyl, and 4-hydroxy derivatives. N-Oxide formation was catalyzed by the flavin-containing monooxygenase (see part II). Carbon monoxide, SKF-525A, metyrapone, and benzylimidazole strongly inhibited N-demethylation and 4-hydroxylation, indicating the participation of P-450 monooxygenase in these reactions. Antibodies to NADPH-P450 reductase inhibited N-demethylation and 4-hydroxylation. Comparison of the metabolism of tamoxifen in untreated male and female rats demonstrated some sexual dimorphism. N-Demethylation was higher in the male rat and 4-hydroxylation was higher in the female. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital (PB), pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN), and methylcholanthrene (MC) enhanced N-demethylation, demonstrating the potential participation of multiple P-450s in N-demethylation. Evidence strongly indicates that CYP3A enzyme(s) catalyzes N-demethylation in liver microsomes of PB- and PCN-treated rats (PB and PCN microsomes, respectively): i) N-demethylation was inhibited by cortisol and erythromycin (alternate substrates) and a time-dependent inhibition was observed with troleandomycin (TAO) in vitro; ii) treatment of female rats with TAO, followed by dissociation of the microsomal TAO-P-450 complex, elevated N-demethylation; iii) treatment of PCN-induced female rats with chloramphenicol inhibited N-demethylation; and iv) polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) to CYP3A1 inhibited N-demethylation in PCN- and PB-treated female rats. Although we were unable to reconstitute the N-demethylation activity with purified CYP3A1, which is difficult to reconstitute, collectively the evidence demonstrated that CYP3A enzymes catalyze N-demethylation in PB and PCN microsomes. By contrast, antibodies against CYP2B1/B2 did not inhibit N-demethylation and reconstituted 2B1 did not catalyze N-demethylation of tamoxifen, indicating that 2B1 was not involved. The increase in N-demethylation by MC treatment appears to be due to elevation of CYP1A1/1A2 (P-450c/d). Alternate substrates of CYP1A1/1A2 inhibited N-demethylation and reconstituted rat CYP 1A1-catalyzed N-demethylation. Surprisingly, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against CYP1A1/1A2 only partially inhibited, and PAbs against CYP1A1 did not inhibit N-demethylation in MC microsomes, indicating that in MC microsomes, 1A1 does not contribute significantly to that reaction. Mab anti-CYP2C11/2C6 (P-450h/k) inhibited N-demethylation in PB, PCN, and control male rat liver microsomes, suggesting that CYP2C11 and/or CYP2C6 catalyze this reaction to some extent.},

abstract = {Cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) has previously been found to reduce fatigue, depression, and cortisol response to heavy exercise training among competitive collegiate athletes and to speed physical and psychological recovery from surgery (1,2). Our study assessed the efficacy of a CBSM program to reduce the frequency of injury and illness among collegiate athletes in a randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial. Following assessment of baseline medical history, mood state, stress, cortisol, sleep, alcohol use, and exercise training, collegiate rowers were stratified by gender and competitive level and randomly assigned to either a control group or a CBSM group. Exercise training information andpsychosocial assessments were repeated immediately following the intervention period, and health care providers who were blinded to participant assignment recorded the frequency of medical visits and the number of days injured or ill until the end of the season. Athletes randomly assigned to a CBSM group experienced significant reductions in the number of illness and injury days as compared to control group athletes. CBSM participants also had half the number of health service visits as did controls. The data suggest that a time-limited CBSM intervention designed specifically for an athlete population may be an effective prophylactic treatment to reduce the incidence of injury and illness among competitive collegiate athletes.},

The underlying mechanisms associated with decreased self-selected knee flexion angles during landing are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between the peak force production at various knee flexion angles (35, 55, 70, and 90°) during isometric squats and the actual knee flexion angles that occur during landing in both men and women. A total of 18 men and 18 women recreational/collegiate athletes performed 4 isometric squats at various knee flexion angles while vertical ground reaction forces were recorded. Participants also performed a jump-landing-jump task while lower extremity kinematics were collected. For women, significant correlations were found between the peak force production at 55 and 70° of knee flexion during isometric squats and the knee flexion angle at initial contact of landing. There were also significant correlations between the peak force production at 55, 70, and 90° of knee flexion during isometric squats and the peak knee flexion angle during landing. These correlations tended to be stronger during isometric squats at greater knee flexion compared with smaller knee flexion. No significant correlations were found for men. Posture-specific strength may play an important role in determining self-selected knee flexion angles during landing for women.},

Sixteen trained male amateur soccer players volunteered to take part in the study (age 17.2 ± 1.02 years, body height 176.25 ± 0.07 m, body mass 67.67 ± 13.27 kg). Following familiarization sessions, postural control was evaluated using one-leg and both-leg quiet-stance positions by measuring postural sway with a Tekscan HR Mat™ in anterior–posterior and medial–lateral directions. Later, 1:1, 2:2 and 3:3 SSGs were performed at two-day intervals and the technical variables specified for each game were analyzed. A Spearman's rank-order correlation analysis demonstrated the relationship between postural control and soccer-specific technical variables in 1:1 (r-values ranging from 0.582 to 0.776), 2:2 (r-values ranging from 0.511 to 0.740) and 3:3 (r-values ranging from 0.502 to 0.834) SSGs. In addition, a Wilcoxon signed rank test revealed differences between SSGs in terms of several variables. The results of the study showed that higher postural control levels are among the important variables that affect success in the performance of technical skills under rival pressure and suddenly changing conditions. Therefore, it is recommended that in addition to its use for injury prevention purposes, balance training should be conducted to improve branch-specific technical skills and to increase the levels of their successful performance in a game.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. Purpose: To investigate how the viscoelastic characteristics of muscles (non-neural tone, elasticity and stiffness) vary as a function of age and gender in a sample of track and field master athletes. To compare these findings with data on related sedentary subjects in literature. Methods: A total of 390 athletes (aged 35–99) were assessed during the European Master Athletics Indoor Championship 2016. A non-invasive measurement device called MyotonPro was used to measure tone, stiffness, and elasticity in the biceps brachii and rectus femoris muscles at rest. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between age and the measured parameters. To compare our results with previously reported data, we stratified participants according to gender and age. Results: Tone was found to not be dependent on age, whereas stiffness was found to be age dependent. Elasticity was found to be both physical activity and age dependent. Tone (only for men), elasticity, and stiffness were lower in master athletes than in sedentary subjects. Conclusions: Tone, elasticity, and stiffness change with aging; nevertheless, our findings suggest that physical activity can delay the effects of muscular aging, improving fitness in older people.},

abstract = {Background Wavelet transform based analysis of heart rate variability is increasingly being used for a wide variety of clinical applications. There is no gold standard as to which wavelet to use and the correlation between results obtained by using different wavelets is unknown. Methods Heart rate variability in electrocardiograms from healthy volunteers was analyzed using the following wavelets (maximum overlap discrete wavelet packet transform): Haar, Daubechies 2, 4, and 8, least asymmetric Daubechies 4 and 8, and best localized Daubechies 7 using the RHRV package in R. Correlation of power in the different frequency bands (ultra low frequency (ULF), very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF)) as well as total power and LF:HF ratio were calculated. Bland-Altman comparisons were also made for selected wavelets to test for agreement. Findings Correlations between results obtained by different wavelets were all statistically significant. Most correlation coefficients were moderate (0.3 ≤ r ≤ 0.7). They were, however, generally lower for the LF:HF ratio, which is commonly used to assess balance of the autonomic nervous system. Conclusion It is necessary to report which wavelet is used when performing wavelet transform based heart rate variability analysis and depending on whether one is interested in detecting onset or intensity of changes performance of wavelets will vary.},

abstract = {This consensus statement summarizes key contemporary research themes relevant to understanding the psychology and socioculture of sport injury. Special consideration is given toward high-intensity sport in which elite athlete training and performance efforts are characterized by explosive physical speed and strength, mental fortitude to push physical limits, and maximum effort and commitment to highly challenging goals associated with achieving exceptional performance. Sport injury occurrence in high-intensity sport is an adverse and stressful health event associated with a complex multitude of risks, consequences and outcomes. A biopsychosocial (Engel, 1980) view is advocated which contextualizes an understanding of the psychological aspects of sport injury in light of influential sociocultural, ethical, and biomedical issues. Outcomes related to athlete health and performance excellence are of equal importance in considering how psychological scholarship, expertise and services can be used to improve efforts focused on the prevention and management of sport injury among high-intensity athletes. The consensus view is that psychology and socioculture do affect sport injury risk, response and recovery in high-intensity athletes, and that continued efforts in psychological research and professional practice are needed to protect athlete physical and mental health and contribute toward performance excellence and career longevity.},

abstract = {What is the price of sports participation? The recently released Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee Report (United States Department of Health {\&} Human Services [USDHHS], 2008) refers to sport injury as one of the prices, or " adverse events, " associated with regular physical activity such as competitive sport participation. Evidence in the colloquium paper presented by Zernicke, Antle, McLean, Palmieri-Smith, Miller, and Wojtys (2009)—entitled Play at Your Own Risk: Sport and the Injury Epidemic—demonstrates the magni-tude and extent of this sport injury price, and provides a comprehensive and mul-tifaceted look at both the nature of the problem and cutting edge, research-based solutions. As a reactor to their paper, my frames of reference include those of a (a) scholar in sport and exercise psychology with specific expertise in the psychology of sport injury, (b) former intercollegiate athlete who sustained many sport inju-ries herself, and, (c) former intercollegiate coach who dealt on the front lines with numerous athletes incurring and recovering from sport injuries. Is excellence in sport compatible with good health? Within the specific con-text of intercollegiate sport injury, my answer to this question relates to two salient themes that emerged for me in reaction to Zernicke et al.'s (2009) paper: first, that one must consider multiple dimensions of athlete health to fully grasp the compat-ibility of excellence and health, and second, that one must consider the full lifespan of intercollegiate athletes when answering the question. First, with respect to multiple dimensions, some of the key dimensions of athlete health affected by sport injury include physical (e.g., general health and functioning, orthopedic health, sport performance), social (e.g., ability to interact with other individuals), cognitive (e.g., ability to process information and act properly), emotional (e.g., ability to cope, adjust, and adapt), spiritual (e.g., belief in some force or dynamic other than humans), philosophical (e.g., the belief system that governs engagement), and economic (e.g., financial livelihood and support for activities). Furthermore, in addition to sport injury affecting multiple dimensions of the injured athlete's own health, there is the health of the broader system to consider. Injury affects more than the injured; it often also holds health-related consequences for the network of family, friends, teammates, coaching The author is with the School of Kinesiology, Cooke Hall, University of Minnesota, 1900 University Ave SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455. Sport Injury and College Athlete Health 65 staff and even the larger communities, all who rely in some way on the healthy presence and performance of these athletes for their own well-being. For example, I have receive many searching—and often nearly desperate—e-mail and phone contacts from parents of injured athletes, so troubled themselves to see their child suffering the gamut of health-related consequences that they in turn are over-whelmed and unhealthy and seeking advice as to how to assist their young person. Therefore, my point is that in many ways sport injury affects both the multidimen-sional " internal " health of the injured athlete, as well as the multidimensional " external " health of the system surrounding them. Second, adopting a lifespan view means considering these multidimensional, health-related implications of sport injury across the entire life cycle of the inter-collegiate athlete (see Figure 1). For example, many of the lifespan issues related to sport injury occur even before intercollegiate participation. In a macro-systemic health sense, the entire youth sport culture in today's society is unfortunately all too often one of excess and a willingness to sacrifice health—physical, psycho-logical, social—in a misguided attempt to achieve the ultimate dream of a college scholarship and perhaps even a professional contract. As evidenced by many recent popular press publications on the topic (e.g., Farrey, 2008; Sokolove, 2008), parents, coaches, and other social influences on impressionable young athletes push the extremes of participation for their kids in a quest for fame, glory and wealth, often with unfortunate consequences for health. But other recent popular publications (e.g., Gladwell, 2008) remind us that there is also an extraordinary amount of luck and good fortune—being in the right place at the right time, so to speak—involved in most areas of success in life, including sports. So to be willing to sacrifice the good health of young, vulnerable athletes (whether they want it for themselves; oftentimes even they do not know) in the sole hopes of creating the future college champion is dangerous and saddening. And many other such books and publications (e.g., Nowinski, 2006; Sokolove, 2008) illustrate for us the long-term, postcollege consequences of a " do or die " attitude embracing the normative sport ethic—ingrained in athletes from the youngest of ages: to play with pain, Figure 1 — Chronology of sport injury and health across the lifespan.},

abstract = {Basic to all motile life is a differential approach/avoid response to perceived features of environment. The stages of response are initial reflexive noticing and orienting to the stimulus, preparation, and execution of response. Preparation involves a coordination of many aspects of the organism: muscle tone, posture, breathing, autonomic functions, motivational/emotional state, attentional orientation, and expectations. The organism organizes itself in relation to the challenge. We propose to call this the "preparatory set" (PS). We suggest that the concept of the PS can offer a more nuanced and flexible perspective on the stress response than do current theories. We also hypothesize that the mechanisms of body-mind therapeutic and educational systems (BTES) can be understood through the PS framework. We suggest that the BTES, including meditative movement, meditation, somatic education, and the body-oriented psychotherapies, are approaches that use interventions on the PS to remedy stress and trauma. We discuss how the PS can be adaptive or maladaptive, how BTES interventions may restore adaptive PS, and how these concepts offer a broader and more flexible view of the phenomena of stress and trauma. We offer supportive evidence for our hypotheses, and suggest directions for future research. We believe that the PS framework will point to ways of improving the management of stress and trauma, and that it will suggest directions of research into the mechanisms of action of BTES.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To hypothesize that increased heart rate (HR) and decreased heart rate variability (HRV) occurs not only during stressful events but also during episodes in which stress is cognitively represented, but not necessarily present, i.e., during worry. METHODS: Ambulatory HR and HRV of 73 female and male teachers were recorded for 4 days, during which they reported, on an hourly basis using computerized diaries, the number and characteristics of worry episodes and stressful events. Multilevel regression models were used, controlling for biobehavioral variables. RESULTS: Compared with neutral periods, worry episodes and stressful events had independent effects on HR (2.00 beats/min and 2.75 beats/min, respectively) and HRV (-1.07 ms and -1.05, respectively). Neither psychological traits nor biobehavioral variables influenced these results. Effects were most pronounced for work-related worry on HR (9.16 beats/min) and HRV (-1.19 ms), and for worry about anticipated future stress on HR (4.79 beats/min). CONCLUSIONS: Worry in daily life might have substantial cardiac effects in addition to the effects of stressful events, especially in the form of work-related and anticipatory stress, the latter being a type of stress that has been largely neglected in stress research.},

abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage-Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Here we present a theory of human trauma and chronic stress, based on the practice of Somatic Experiencing({\textregistered}) (SE), a form of trauma therapy that emphasizes guiding the client's attention to interoceptive, kinesthetic, and proprioceptive experience. SE™ claims that this style of inner attention, in addition to the use of kinesthetic and interoceptive imagery, can lead to the resolution of symptoms resulting from chronic and traumatic stress. This is accomplished through the completion of thwarted, biologically based, self-protective and defensive responses, and the discharge and regulation of excess autonomic arousal. We present this theory through a composite case study of SE treatment; based on this example, we offer a possible neurophysiological rationale for the mechanisms involved, including a theory of trauma and chronic stress as a functional dysregulation of the complex dynamical system formed by the subcortical autonomic, limbic, motor and arousal systems, which we term the core response network (CRN). We demonstrate how the methods of SE help restore functionality to the CRN, and we emphasize the importance of taking into account the instinctive, bodily based protective reactions when dealing with stress and trauma, as well as the effectiveness of using attention to interoceptive, proprioceptive and kinesthetic sensation as a therapeutic tool. Finally, we point out that SE and similar somatic approaches offer a supplement to cognitive and exposure therapies, and that mechanisms similar to those discussed in the paper may also be involved in the benefits of meditation and other somatic practices.},

IntroductionThe Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) considers new evidence of climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes.This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment.The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement.},

abstract = {With increased professionalism in sport there has been a greater interest in the scientific approach to training and recovery of athletes. Applying appropriate training loads along with adequate recovery, is essential in gaining maximal adaptation in athletes, while minimizing harm such as overreaching, overtraining, injury and illness. Although appropriate physical stress is essential, stress for many athletes may come from areas other than training. Stress from may arise from social or environmental pressure, and for many athletes who combine elite athletic training with university study, academic workloads create significant stress which adds to the constant pressure to perform athletically. This research aimed to determine if subjective stressors were associated with counterproductive training adaptations in university athletes. Moreover, it aimed to elucidate if, and when, such stressors are most harmful (i.e., certain times of the academic year or sports training season). We monitored subjective (mood state, energy levels, academic stress, sleep quality/quantity, muscle soreness, training load) and objective (injury and illness) markers in 182 young (18-22 years) elite athletes over a 4-year period using a commercially available software package. Athletes combined full-time university study with elite sport and training obligations. Results suggest athletes were relatively un-stressed with high levels of energy at the beginning of each university semester, however, energy levels deteriorated along with sleep parameters toward the examination periods of the year. A logistical regression indicated decreased levels of perceived mood (0.89, 0.85-0.94, Odds Ratio and 95{\%} confidence limits), sleep duration (0.94, 0.91-0.97) and increased academic stress (0.91, 0.88-0.94) and energy levels (1.07, 1.01-1.14) were able to predict injury in these athletes. Examination periods coincided with the highest stress levels and increased likelihood of illness. Additionally, a sudden and high increase in training workload during the preseason was associated with an elevated incidence of injury and illness (r = 0.63). In conclusion, young elite athletes undertaking full-time university study alongside their training and competition loads were vulnerable to increased levels of stress at certain periods of the year (pre-season and examination time). Monitoring and understanding these stressors may assist coaches and support staff in managing overall stress in these athletes.},

abstract = {An introduction is provided to Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), a logic system that integrates First Order Logic (FOL) with Bayesian probability theory. MEBN extends ordinary Bayesian networks to allow representation of graphical models with repeated sub-structures. Knowledge is encoded as a collection of Bayesian network fragments (MFrags) that can be instantiated and combined to form highly complex situation-specific Bayesian networks. A MEBN theory (MTheory) implicitly represents a joint probability distribution over possibly unbounded numbers of hypotheses, and uses Bayesian learning to refine a knowledge base as observations accrue. MEBN provides a logical foundation for the emerging collection of highly expressive probability-based languages. A running example illustrates the representation and reasoning power of the MEBN formalism.},

In this paper we use Bayesian networks to determine and visualise the interactions among various Class III malocclusion maxillofacial features during growth and treatment. We start from a sample of 143 patients characterised through a series of a maximum of 21 different craniofacial features. We estimate a network model from these data and we test its consistency by verifying some commonly accepted hypotheses on the evolution of these disharmonies by means of Bayesian statistics. We show that untreated subjects develop different Class III craniofacial growth patterns as compared to patients submitted to orthodontic treatment with rapid maxillary expansion and facemask therapy. Among treated patients the CoA segment (the maxillary length) and the ANB angle (the antero-posterior relation of the maxilla to the mandible) seem to be the skeletal subspaces that receive the main effect of the treatment.},

We studied the strength, flexibility, and balance characteristics of golfers across 3 proficiency levels based on handicap index (HCP) ({\textless}0, 1-9, and 10-20) to determine the physical characteristics unique to highly proficient golfers. A total of 257 (age: 45.5 +/- 12.8 years, height: 180.6 +/- 6.5 cm, weight: 87.9 +/- 12.6 kg) healthy, male golfers participated in the study. Testing included an assessment of strength (torso, shoulder, and hip), flexibility (torso, shoulder, and hip), and single-leg balance. Golfers in the highest proficiency group (HCP {\textless} 0) had significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) greater hip strength, torso strength, shoulder strength, shoulder flexibility, hip flexibility, torso flexibility, and balance (eyes open) than golfers in the lowest proficiency group (HCP 10-20). The results of this study demonstrate that better golfers possess unique physical characteristics that are important to greater proficiency. These characteristics have also been demonstrated to be modifiable through golf-specific training programs.},

Recently, rapid development has occurred in the clinical assessment of autonomic function. Various procedures have been described as diagnostic tools to monitor autonomic dysfunction. Some of them are mostly used for research purposes. Many, however, have found their place in routine clinical evaluation. Our paper presents selected methods of assessment of the autonomic nervous system with particular emphasis on those that are useful in diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular system. We discuss multiple tests based on cardiovascular reflexes, methods of studying heart rate variability as well as direct catecholamine measurements. Moreover, we outline tests of sudomotor function and microneurography.},

Moreover, some hormones, commonly assayed in plasma, such as steroids, are detectable in oral fluid and peptide/protein, and non-steroid hormones have been investigated. The sports practice environment and athletes' availability, together with hormone molecule characteristics in saliva and physical exercise behavior effects, confirm this body fluid as an alternative to serum. This review focuses on the relation between salivary steroids and psycho-physiological stress and underlines how the measurement of salivary cortisol provides an approach of self-report psychological indicator and anxiety change in relation to exercise performance. The correlation between salivary and plasma steroid hormone (cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) levels, observed during exercise, has been considered, underlining how the type, duration, and intensity of the exercise influence the salivary steroid concentrations in the same way as serum-level variations. Training conditions have been considered in relation to the salivary hormonal response. This review focuses on studies related to salivary hormone measurements, mainly steroids, in physical exercise. Saliva use in physical disciplines, as a real alternative to serum, could be a future perspective.},

Subsequent prospective analyses further indicated that high-LES athletes were more likely to be symptomatic than low-LES athletes and that elevated Cortisol level was positively correlated with symptomatology. To the extent that Cortisol is a marker of exercise recovery in competitive atbletes, our results suggest that chronic stress prolongs the recovery process, which may potentially widen a window of susceptibility for illness and injury among competitive athletes.},

The aim of the current study was to evaluate salivary cortisol and perceptual stress markers during competition and training and to determine the subsequent effects on sleep indices in elite female athletes. Ten elite female netball athletes (mean ± SD; age: 23 ± 6 years) had their sleep monitored on three occasions; following one netball competition match (MATCH), one netball match simulation session (TRAIN), and one rest day (CONTROL). Perceived stress values and salivary cortisol were collected immediately pre- (17:15 pm) and post-session (19:30 pm), and at 22:00 pm. Sleep monitoring was performed using wrist actigraphy assessing total time in bed, total sleep time (TST), efficiency (SE{\%}), latency, sleep onset time and wake time. Cortisol levels were significantly higher (p  {\textless}  .01) immediately post MATCH compared with TRAIN and CONTROL (mean ± SD; 0.700 ± 0.165, 0.178 ± 0.127 and 0.157 ± 0.178 $\mu$g/dL, respectively) and at 22:00 pm (0.155 ± 0.062, 0.077 ± 0.063, and 0.089 ± 0.083 $\mu$g/dL, respectively).

abstract = {The analysis of injury data requires different considerations from the analysis of other types of outcomes because an individual can experience the outcome many times. When describing injury patterns using numerator-only data (e.g., proportion of upper-extremity injuries vs. lower-extremity injuries), simple comparisons of proportions are inappropriate because 1) individuals are compared with themselves and 2) multiple testing increases the potential for incorrect inference. Bootstrapping (resampling) techniques can be used to determine confidence intervals and whether the frequencies significantly differ across categories. When describing injury rates, the authors suggest plotting the observed injury rate against the number of exposures to obtain a visual representation of the heterogeneity of risk across individuals. Because the distribution of injury rates is often skewed, some research questions may be best addressed by comparing the weighted median injury rates instead of the weighted mean injury rates (which are given by standard formulae). Again, resampling techniques can be used to obtain a null distribution for injury rates in order to determine whether there are subjects who have unexpectedly high injury rates. More advanced analyses are required to account for multiplicity.},

The purpose of this study was to examine mean leg stiffness and bilateral differences in leg stiffness across an entire professional Australian Football League (AFL) season, and determine whether this parameter was related to the incidence of lower body soft tissue injury. The stiffness of the left and right legs of 39 professional AFL players (age 24.4 ± 4.4 years, body mass 87.4 ± 8.1 kg, stature 1.87 ± 0.07 m) was measured using a unilateral hopping test at least once per month throughout the season. Injury data were obtained directly from the head medical officer at the football club. Mean leg stiffness and bilateral differences in leg stiffness were compared between the injured and non-injured players. There was no difference between the season mean leg stiffness values for the injured (219.3 ± 16.1 N x m(-1) x kg(-1)) and non-injured (217.4 ± 14.9 N x m(-1) x kg(-1); P = 0.721) groups. The injured group (7.5 ± 3.0{\%}) recorded a significantly higher season mean bilateral difference in leg stiffness than the non-injured group (5.5 ± 1.3{\%}; P = 0.05). A relatively high bilateral difference in leg stiffness appears to be related to the incidence of soft tissue injury in Australian football players. This information is of particular importance to medical and conditioning staff across a variety of sports.},

abstract = {Psychophysiological research integrating heart rate variability (HRV) has increased during the last two decades, particularly given the fact that HRV is able to index cardiac vagal tone. Cardiac vagal tone, which represents the contribution of the parasympathetic nervous system to cardiac regulation, is acknowledged to be linked with many phenomena relevant for psychophysiological research, including self-regulation at the cognitive, emotional, social, and health levels. The ease of HRV collection and measurement coupled with the fact it is relatively affordable, non-invasive and pain free makes it widely accessible to many researchers. This ease of access should not obscure the difficulty of interpretation of HRV findings that can be easily misconstrued, however, this can be controlled to some extent through correct methodological processes. Standards of measurement were developed two decades ago by a Task Force within HRV research, and recent reviews updated several aspects of the Task Force paper. However, many methodological aspects related to HRV in psychophysiological research have to be considered if one aims to be able to draw sound conclusions, which makes it difficult to interpret findings and to compare results across laboratories. Those methodological issues have mainly been discussed in separate outlets, making difficult to get a grasp on them, and thus this paper aims to address this issue. It will help to provide psychophysiological researchers with recommendations and practical advice concerning experimental designs, data analysis, and data reporting. This will ensure that researchers starting a project with HRV and cardiac vagal tone are well informed regarding methodological considerations in order for their findings to contribute to knowledge advancement in their field.},

In addition to the significant debates surrounding ideal methods to collect and interpret measures of HRV, standardized reporting of methodology in this field is lacking. Commonly cited recommendations were designed well before recent calls to improve research communication and reproducibility across disciplines. In an effort to standardize reporting, we propose the Guidelines for Reporting Articles on Psychiatry and Heart rate variability (GRAPH), a checklist with four domains: participant selection, interbeat interval collection, data preparation and HRV calculation. This paper provides an overview of these four domains and why their standardized reporting is necessary to suitably evaluate HRV research in psychiatry and related disciplines. Adherence to these communication guidelines will help expedite the translation of HRV research into a potential psychiatric biomarker by improving interpretation, reproducibility and future meta-analyses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous injury is often proposed to be a risk factor for football injury, but most studies rely on players reporting their own medical history and are thus potentially subject to recall bias. Little is known about the natural variation in injury pattern between seasons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To study whether prospectively recorded injuries during one season are associated with injuries sustained during the following season, and to compare injury risk and injury pattern between consecutive seasons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The medical staffs of 12 elite Swedish male football teams prospectively recorded individual exposure and time loss injuries over two full consecutive seasons (2001 and 2002). A multivariate model was used to determine the relation between previous injury, anthropometric data, and the risk of injury.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The training and match injury incidences were similar between seasons (5.1 v 5.3 injuries/1000 training hours and 25.9 v 22.7/1000 match hours), but analysis of injury severity and injury patterns showed variations between seasons. Players who were injured in the 2001 season were at greater risk of any injury in the following season compared with non-injured players (hazard ratio 2.7; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.7 to 4.3, p{\textless}0.0001). Players with a previous hamstring injury, groin injury, and knee joint trauma were two to three times more likely to suffer an identical injury in the following season, whereas no such relation was found for ankle sprain. Age was not associated with an increased injury risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed previous results showing that previous injury is an important risk factor for football injury. Overall injury incidences were similar between consecutive seasons, indicating that an injury surveillance study covering one full season can provide a reasonable overview of the injury problem among elite football players in a specific environment. However, a prolonged study period is recommended for analyses of specific injury patterns.},

abstract = {Many of today's global scientific challenges require the joint involvement of researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds (social sciences, environmental sci-ences, climatology, medicine, etc.). Such interdisciplinary research teams face many challenges resulting from differences in training and scientific culture. Interdisciplinary education programs are required to train truly interdisciplinary scientists with respect to the critical factor skills and competences. For that purpose this paper presents the Method-ology for Interdisciplinary Research (MIR) framework. The MIR framework was devel-oped to help cross disciplinary borders, especially those between the natural sciences and the social sciences. The framework has been specifically constructed to facilitate the design of interdisciplinary scientific research, and can be applied in an educational program, as a reference for monitoring the phases of interdisciplinary research, and as a tool to design such research in a process approach. It is suitable for research projects of different sizes and levels of complexity, and it allows for a range of methods' combinations (case study, mixed methods, etc.). The different phases of designing interdisciplinary research in the MIR framework are described and illustrated by real-life applications in teaching and research. We further discuss the framework's utility in research design in landscape architecture, mixed methods research, and provide an outlook to the framework's potential in inclusive interdisciplinary research, and last but not least, research integrity.},

Thirty-six subjects (age = 22.7 +/- 2.10 years; height = 168.30 +/- 9.55 cm; weight = 71.15 +/- 16.40 kg) were randomly placed into control (C; n = 19) and experimental groups (Tx; n = 17). The Tx group trained using a commercially available balance training device (BOSU). Postural limits (displacement and sway) and functional task (time on ball, shuttle run, and vertical jump) were assessed during a pretest (T1), a posttest (T2), and 2 weeks posttraining (T3). Multivariate repeated measures analysis (alpha = 0.05) revealed significant differences in time on ball, shuttle run, total sway, and fore/aft displacement after the exercise intervention (T2). T3 assessment revealed that total sway and time on ball remained controlled; however, no other measures were retained. Balance training improved performance of selected sport-related activities and postural control measures, although it is unclear whether the effect of training would transfer to general functional enhancement.},

Simple yet meaningful examples in R illustrate each step of the modeling process. The examples start from the simplest notions and gradually increase in complexity. The authors also distinguish the probabilistic models from their estimation with data sets. The first three chapters explain the whole process of Bayesian network modeling, from structure learning to parameter learning to inference. These chapters cover discrete Bayesian, Gaussian Bayesian, and hybrid networks, including arbitrary random variables. The book then gives a concise but rigorous treatment of the fundamentals of Bayesian networks and offers an introduction to causal Bayesian networks. It also presents an overview of R and other software packages appropriate for Bayesian networks. The final chapter evaluates two real-world examples: a landmark causal protein signaling network paper and graphical modeling approaches for predicting the composition of different body parts.

abstract = {Background: Objective measurements would be useful to document the effect of deep brain stimulation in alleviating rigidity in patients with Parkinson's disease. The aim of the study was to examine the changes of viscoelastic properties in skeletal muscles as indicators of rigidity. Methods: Six patients in an advanced stage of Parkinson's disease participated in the study. The study took place in the off-medication conditions after one night of drug withdrawal. The wrist rigidity was examined according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in both sides. Myotonometry (Myoton) was used to determine stiffness and elasticity in extensor digitorum muscles bilaterally. The measurements were repeated and compared during the stimulation-on and stimulation-off periods. Findings: A comparison of mean clinical motor scores revealed a significant improvement of parkinsonian symptoms due to brain stimulation. In particular, arm rigidity improved on average from 2.83 (1-4) in stimulation-off phase to 1.17 (0-2) in stimulation-on phase (P {\textless} 0.05). The mean values of elasticity and stiffness were not significantly different in stimulation-on and stimulation-off conditions. The patients with elevated clinical rigidity scores had higher mean values of stiffness (262.5 vs 211.0; P {\textless} 0.05) but the differences in elasticity were not significant. Interpretation: Increased rigidity is associated with increased values of viscoelastic stiffness. This paper supports the use of myotonometry for objective quantification of rigidity and in the future, this tool could prove helpful for optimizing deep brain stimulation settings in patients with Parkinson's disease. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The study of sports injuries has grown with the increase in importance of sport as a leisure-time activity. The origin of many sports injuries is assumed to be mechanical, with the forces and/or stresses acting on one element of the human locomotor system exceeding the critical limits. This article presents some biomechanical considerations on the mechanical aspect of the aetiology, reduction and treatment of sport injuries with special emphasis on the lower extremities. Forces acting on the locomotor system have a magnitude, a point of application and a direction. Both magnitude and geometry (point of application and direction) are important in load analysis. However, the geometrical aspect of externally acting forces is an extremely important aspect, especially with respect to reduction of load in practical situations. Load analysis is usually performed with force transducers and optical instruments in order to quantify magnitude and geometry. Two possible approaches to load analysis are discussed. One approach works with the critical limits of biomaterials. This approach shows that the local stresses for cartilage, tendon and bone are in the order of 10 to 20{\%} of the critical limit for normal daily activities, such as walking. The second approach deals with strategies to reduce load, assuming that it is usually too high in sports activities. The nature of playing surfaces and shoes are revealed as important possibilities for load reduction.},

abstract = {Abstract Background An anterior cruciate ligament injury may lead to deteriorations in postural stability. The goal of this study was to evaluate postural stability during the transition from double-leg stance to single-leg stance of both legs in anterior cruciate ligament injured subjects and non-injured control subjects with a standardized methodology. Methods Fifteen control subjects and 15 anterior cruciate ligament injured subjects (time after injury: mean (SD) = 1.4 (0.7) months) participated in the study. Both groups were similar for age, gender, height, weight and body mass index. Spatiotemporal center of pressure outcomes of both legs of each subject were measured during the transition from double-leg stance to single-leg stance in eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Movement speed was standardized. Findings The center of pressure displacement after a new stability point was reached during the single-leg stance phase was significantly increased in the anterior cruciate ligament injured group compared to the control group in the eyes closed condition (P {\textless}.001). No significant different postural stability outcomes were found between both legs within both groups (P {\textgreater}.05). No significant differences were found during the transition itself (P {\textgreater}.05). Interpretation The anterior cruciate ligament injured group showed postural stability deficits during the single-leg stance phase compared to the non-injured control group in the eyes closed condition. Using the non-injured leg as a normal reference when evaluating postural stability of the injured leg may lead to misinterpretations, as no significant differences were found between the injured and non-injured leg of the anterior cruciate ligament injured group.},

@article{Gabbett2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND There is dogma that higher training load causes higher injury rates. However, there is also evidence that training has a protective effect against injury. For example, team sport athletes who performed more than 18 weeks of training before sustaining their initial injuries were at reduced risk of sustaining a subsequent injury, while high chronic workloads have been shown to decrease the risk of injury. Second, across a wide range of sports, well-developed physical qualities are associated with a reduced risk of injury. Clearly, for athletes to develop the physical capacities required to provide a protective effect against injury, they must be prepared to train hard. Finally, there is also evidence that under-training may increase injury risk. Collectively, these results emphasise that reductions in workloads may not always be the best approach to protect against injury. MAIN THESIS This paper describes the 'Training-Injury Prevention Paradox' model; a phenomenon whereby athletes accustomed to high training loads have fewer injuries than athletes training at lower workloads. The Model is based on evidence that non-contact injuries are not caused by training per se, but more likely by an inappropriate training programme. Excessive and rapid increases in training loads are likely responsible for a large proportion of non-contact, soft-tissue injuries. If training load is an important determinant of injury, it must be accurately measured up to twice daily and over periods of weeks and months (a season). This paper outlines ways of monitoring training load ('internal' and 'external' loads) and suggests capturing both recent ('acute') training loads and more medium-term ('chronic') training loads to best capture the player's training burden. I describe the critical variable-acute:chronic workload ratio-as a best practice predictor of training-related injuries. This provides the foundation for interventions to reduce players risk, and thus, time-loss injuries. SUMMARY The appropriately graded prescription of high training loads should improve players' fitness, which in turn may protect against injury, ultimately leading to (1) greater physical outputs and resilience in competition, and (2) a greater proportion of the squad available for selection each week.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We examined the role of stress, competitive anxiety, mood state, and social support in athletic injury. Specifically, we hypothesized that athletes reporting high levels of stress, high competitive trait anxiety, negative mood state, and low social support would exhibit greater incidence of injury and injury severity. DESIGN AND SETTING: Correlational analysis. Major Canadian university. SUBJECTS: Voluntary sample, 55 male varsity athletes (42 football, 81{\%} of the football team, and 13 rugby, 74{\%} of the rugby team), ages 19-28 yr (x = 22). MEASUREMENTS: The inventories Sport Competition Anxiety Test (SCAT), Social Support Scale, Social Athletic Readjustment Rating Scale (SARRS), and Profile of Mood States (POMS) were administered. Internal consistency of the self- report measures was tested using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Injury rate and severity were recorded by the head student therapist throughout the season. RESULTS: Correlational analyses performed using Pearson correlational coefficient revealed that competitive anxiety (r = .29, p = .03) and tension/anxiety mood states (r = .43, p = .001) were related to injury frequency, and that tension/anxiety (r = .44, p = .008), anger/hostility (r = .30, p = .02), and total negative mood state (r = .28, p = .038) were related to injury severity. Individually, the two sports yielded somewhat different results: for football, injury frequency and injury severity were related to tension/ anxiety (r = .43, p = .004 and r = .47, p = .002, respectively). Vigor/activity was found to be significantly related to injury rate (p = .02), but since the internal consistency of vigor/activity was less than .70 on the Cronbach alpha scale, this significant finding was disregarded. In rugby, injury frequency was related to tension/anxiety (r = .58, p = .04) and depression/ dejection (r = .57, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are useful for athletic trainers in identifying athletes who may possess psychological factors predisposing them to athletic injury. Subsequently, athletic trainers can instruct these athletes or refer them for assistance in psychological preventive interventions.},

abstract = {Injuries are a common occurrence in team sports and can have significant financial, physical and psychological consequences for athletes and their sporting organizations. As such, an abundance of research has attempted to identify factors associated with the risk of injury, which is important when developing injury prevention and risk mitigation strategies. There are a number of methods that can be used to identify injury risk factors. However, difficulty in understanding the nuances between different statistical approaches can lead to incorrect inferences and decisions being made from data. Accordingly, this narrative review aims to (1) outline commonly implemented methods for determining injury risk, (2) highlight the differences between association and prediction as it relates to injury and (3) describe advances in statistical modeling and the current evidence relating to predicting injuries in sport. Based on the points that are discussed throughout this narrative review, both researchers and practitioners alike need to carefully consider the different types of variables that are examined in relation to injury risk and how the analyses pertaining to these different variables are interpreted. There are a number of other important considerations when modeling the risk of injury, such as the method of data transformation, model validation and performance assessment. With these technical considerations in mind, researchers and practitioners should consider shifting their perspective of injury etiology from one of reductionism to one of complexity. Concurrently, research implementing reductionist approaches should be used to inform and implement complex approaches to identifying injury risk. However, the ability to capture large injury numbers is a current limitation of sports injury research and there has been a call to make data available to researchers, so that analyses and results can be replicated and verified. Collaborative efforts such as this will help prevent incorrect inferences being made from spurious data and will assist in developing interventions that are underpinned by sound scientific rationale. Such efforts will be a step in the right direction of improving the ability to identify injury risk, which in turn will help improve risk mitigation and ultimately the prevention of injuries.},

abstract = {High cardiovascular and cortisol reactivity to stressful tasks are predictors of increased future cardiovascular risk. Few studies have investigated the impact of shift work on cardiovascular reactivity, and none have examined cortisol reactivity. The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and cortisol stress reactivity in female shift workers (SW) versus non-shift workers (NSW). Nineteen SW (40 AE 11 years) and 19 NSW (42 AE 11 years) participated. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at rest, and during each minute of a speech (5 min) and mental arithmetic (5 min) stress task. Serum cortisol was measured pre-and poststress task (immediately and 15 min post). Values are means AE SD. Peak increases in DBP during the task did not differ between groups (p ¼ .261), however, analyzed over time there was an interaction such that DBP increased significantly more in SW during the fifth minute of the speech task (p ¼ .035). There were no group differences in heart rate or systolic blood pressure responses. The increase in cortisol also did not differ between groups ({\'{A}}SW: 5.5 AE 7.5 mg/dL, {\'{A}}NSW: 1.8 AE 2.9 mg/dL, p ¼ .165). However, when compared separately, the increase in cortisol from baseline to peak poststress was significant in SW (p ¼ .013) but not in NSW (p ¼ .125). In conclusion, these preliminary data suggest that shift work exposure may have a modest influence on cardio-vascular and cortisol reactivity. Further research is necessary to fully characterize and explore the importance of stress reactivity in this population.},

This biological theory of personality - now widely known as 'Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory' (RST) - has had a major influence on motivation, emotion and psychopathology research. In 2000, RST was substantially revised by Jeffrey Gray, together with Neil McNaughton, and this revised theory proposed three principal motivation/emotion systems: the 'Fight-Flight-Freeze System' (FFFS), the 'Behavioural Approach System' (BAS) and the 'Behavioural Inhibition System' (BIS). This is the first book to summarise the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of personality and bring together leading researchers in the field. It summarizes all of the pre-2000 RST research findings, explains and elaborates the implications of the 2000 theory for personality psychology and lays out the future research agenda for RST.},

Objective: To assess muscle passive stiffness in medicated Parkinson's disease patients using myotonometry. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Kinesiology laboratory. Participants: Women with Parkinson's disease (PD) (n=8) and healthy matched elderly women (controls) (n=10) (mean age: PD, 77±3y; controls, 77±4y). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Passive stiffness of relaxed biceps brachii (BB) muscle was measured using myotonometry. Additionally, surface electromyographic and mechanomyographic signals were recorded from the muscle at rest, and amplitude of those signals was analyzed offline. Results: The values of BB muscle passive stiffness were significantly (P=.004) higher in PD than in the controls, with a statistically significant influence of parkinsonian rigidity score (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) on intergroup differences (P{\textless}.001). The Spearman correlation coefficient $\rho$ value showed a significant (P=.005) positive relationship ($\rho$=.866) between the parkinsonian rigidity score and passive stiffness values of BB in PD. The groups did not differ significantly in the electromyogram amplitude (P=.631) and mechanomyogram amplitude (P=.593) of the BB muscle, and values of these parameters did not correlate significantly with rigidity score (P=.555, P=.745, respectively) in the patients. Conclusions: Myotonometer is a sensitive enough tool to show that PD patients have higher muscle passive stiffness than healthy controls. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

The highest injury incidence as well as PMI was in motorcycle, handball, skating, and ice hockey. Females had higher risk of a PMI compared with males in automobile sport, handball, floorball, and football. High-risk sports with numerous injuries and high incidence of PMI injuries were motorcycle, handball, ice hockey, football, floorball, and automobile sports.

abstract = {Context: There is a lack of research on sex differences for severe injuries across a variety of sports at the collegiate level. Objective: To compare differences in injury severity and concussion between sexes and collegiate sports. Design: Descriptive epidemiological study. Participants: 1,657 injuries were analyzed from collegiate teams at York University. Data Collection and Analysis: Injuries were assessed by a certified or student athletic therapist and were categorized based on degree of tissue and/or joint damage as either severe or nonsevere. Severe injuries included those with third degree damage, while all others were classified as nonsevere. Injury severity was compared between the sexes and across different sports using Pearson chi-square analysis. Logistic regression was used to assess the relative contribution of each covariate. Results: Males sustained 1,155 injuries, with 13.3{\%} of them being severe, while females sustained only 502 injuries, 17.7{\%} of which were severe. The odds of sustaining severe injuries among female athletes are 1.4 times the odds of male athletes (OR: 1.40, CI 1.05-1.86). Eleven percent of all female injuries were concussions--significantly more than males ($\chi$² = 1 1.03, p = .001). The odds of female athletes having a concussion are 1.9 times the odds of a male athlete (OR: 1.85, CI 1.28-2.67). Conclusion: Based on our analysis, females are at an increased risk of sustaining a severe injury, particularly concussions. These findings highlight the need for future research into sex and sport-specific risk factors. This may provide information for health care professionals, coaches, and athletes for the proper prevention, on-field care, and treatment of sport injuries.},

abstract = {Stressful life events (SLEs) are exceedingly common and have been associated with a range of psychological disorders, perhaps through dysregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The use of certain emotion regulation strategies in response to stress, such as expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal, has additionally been linked to heightened HPA axis reactivity to acute stress. However, it is unclear how emotion regulation may interact with SLEs to affect HPA axis reactivity, particularly concerning relationship stressors (RSs). Using cross-sectional data from 117 men and 85 women aged 18–55 years old (M = 39.9 ± 10.7), we investigated whether trait use of suppression or reappraisal interacted with recent negatively perceived SLEs and relationship stressors to impact HPA axis response to an acute stressor. Separate area under the curve and linear mixed models revealed that trait suppression interacted with SLEs and RSs to predict cortisol response to stress, while reappraisal did not. Findings indicate higher trait expressive suppression may influence the cortisol response to acute stress after exposure to more recent stressful events, particularly when those stressful events include relationship stress.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to summarize knowledge. Pairwise or network meta-analysis may be carried out with multivariate models that account for the dependence between treatment estimates and quantify the correlation across studies. From a different perspective, meta-analysis may be viewed as a special case of multilevel analysis having a hierarchical data structure. Hence, we introduce an alternative frequentist approach, called multilevel network meta-analysis, which also allows to account for publication bias and the presence of inconsistency. We propose our approach for a three-level data structure set-up: arms within studies at the first level, studies within study designs at the second level and design configuration at the third level. This strategy differs from the traditional frequentist modeling because it works directly on an arm-based data structure. An advantage of using multilevel analysis is its flexibility, since it naturally allows to add further levels to the model and to accommodate for multiple outcome variables. Moreover, multilevel modeling may be carried out with widely available statistical programs.Finally, we compare the results from our approach with those from a Bayesian network meta-analysis on a binary endpoint which examines the effect on mortality of some anesthetics at the longest follow-up available. In addition, we compare results from the Bayesian and multilevel network meta-analysis approaches on a publicly available "Thrombolytic drugs" database. We also provide the reader with a blueprint of SAS codes for fitting the proposed models, although our approach does not rely on any specific software.},

However, the type of training that is most efficient remains unclear, as well as the frequency, intensity and duration of the exercise that would be most beneficial have not yet been determined. The following review is based on papers that were found through computerized searches of PubMed and SportDiscus from 2000 to 2016. Articles related to balance training, testing, and injury prevention in young healthy athletes were considered. Based on a Boolean search strategy the independent researchers performed a literature review. A total of 2395 articles were evaluated, yet only 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. In most of the reviewed articles, balance training has proven to be an effective tool for the improvement of postural control. It is difficult to establish one model of training that would be appropriate for each sport discipline, including its characteristics and demands. The main aim of this review was to identify a training protocol based on most commonly used interventions that led to improvements in balance. Our choice was specifically established on the assessment of the effects of balance training on postural control and injury prevention as well as balance training methods. The analyses including papers in which training protocols demonstrated positive effects on balance performance suggest that an efficient training protocol should last for 8 weeks, with a frequency of two training sessions per week, and a single training session of 45 min. This standard was established based on 36 reviewed studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the associations between people's trait-like patterns of stress in daily life (stressor frequency, perceived stressor severity, affective reactivity to stressors, and negative affect) and laboratory-assessed heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: Data were collected from 909 participants aged 35 to 85 years in the Midlife in the United States Study. Participants reported negative affect and minor stressful events during telephone interviews on 8 consecutive evenings. On a separate occasion, HRV was measured from electrocardiograph recordings taken at rest during a laboratory-based psychophysiology protocol. Regression models were used to evaluate the associations between daily stress processes and three log-transformed HRV indices: standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDRR), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and high-frequency power (high-frequency HRV [HF-HRV]). Analyses were adjusted for demographics, body mass index, comorbid conditions, medications, physical activity, and smoking. RESULTS: Stressor frequency was unrelated to HRV (r values ranging from -0.04 to -0.01, p values {\textgreater}.20). However, people with greater perceived stressor severity had lower resting SDRR (fully adjusted B [standard error {\{}SE{\}}] = -0.05 [0.02]), RMSSD (-0.08 [0.03]), and HF-HRV (-0.16 [0.07]). Individuals with more pronounced affective reactivity to stressors also had lower levels of all three HRV indices (SDRR: B [SE] = -0.28 [0.14]; RMSSD: -0.44 [0.19]; HF-HRV: -0.96 [0.37]). Furthermore, aggregated daily negative affect was linked to reduced RMSSD (B [SE] = -0.16 [0.08]) and HF-HRV (-0.35 [0.15]). CONCLUSIONS: In a national sample, individual differences in daily negative affect and responses to daily stressors were more strongly related to cardiovascular autonomic regulation than the frequency of such stressors.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE To investigate predictors of increased frontal plane knee projection angle (FPKPA) in athletes. BACKGROUND The underlying mechanisms that lead to increased FPKPA are likely multifactorial and depend on how the musculoskeletal system adapts to the possible interactions between its distal and proximal segments. Bivariate and linear analyses traditionally employed to analyze the occurrence of increased FPKPA are not sufficiently robust to capture complex relationships among predictors. The investigation of nonlinear interactions among biomechanical factors is necessary to further our understanding of the interdependence of lower-limb segments and resultant dynamic knee alignment. METHODS The FPKPA was assessed in 101 athletes during a single-leg squat and in 72 athletes at the moment of landing from a jump. The investigated predictors were sex, hip abductor isometric torque, passive range of motion (ROM) of hip internal rotation (IR), and shank-forefoot alignment. Classification and regression trees were used to investigate nonlinear interactions among predictors and their influence on the occurrence of increased FPKPA. RESULTS During single-leg squatting, the occurrence of high FPKPA was predicted by the interaction between hip abductor isometric torque and passive hip IR ROM. At the moment of landing, the shank-forefoot alignment, abductor isometric torque, and passive hip IR ROM were predictors of high FPKPA. In addition, the classification and regression trees established cutoff points that could be used in clinical practice to identify athletes who are at potential risk for excessive FPKPA. CONCLUSION The models captured nonlinear interactions between hip abductor isometric torque, passive hip IR ROM, and shank-forefoot alignment.},

abstract = {While the call for interdisciplinary studies has been loud and clear over the last decade or so, the number of interdisciplinary publications in sport sciences is rather limited. One of the reasons for this scarcity is the complexity of the research process itself. Still, the combination and integration of information from different scientific disciplines seems to be important to better explain how elite performance comes about. In this article, we focus on this issue and discuss the advantages of inter- disciplinary research for understanding how elite athletes are able to achieve such high-proficiency levels. The first section provides an over- view of the studies that investigated elite performance in sports. In the second section, we focus on the issue of interdisciplinarity and illustrate how the ecological–dynamical approach and the concept of dimen- sional reduction can be used to explain how elite performers cope with the complex nature of sport skills. In the last section, we present a research outline and some practical considerations that can be helpful for researchers who aim to study sport skills from an interdisciplinary perspective.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Saliva, which offers a noninvasive and stress-free alternative to plasma and serum, is a widely accepted sample source for analysis of steroids and also of certain amines and peptides. In recent years, numerous publications have described the use of salivary hormone analysis in many fields of clinical and basic research. CONTENT This review provides an overview of the current applications of salivary hormone analysis. A description of the different modes of hormone entry into saliva is followed by a detailed description of analytical methods and approaches for reliable collection of saliva, including several interesting applications in diverse fields including psychiatry, stress research, clinical endocrinology, sports medicine, and veterinary medicine. SUMMARY Although saliva has not yet become a mainstream sample source for hormone analysis, it has proven to be reliable and, in some cases, even superior to other body fluids. Nevertheless much effort will be required for this approach to receive acceptance over the long term, especially by clinicians. Such effort includes the development of specific and standardized analytical tools, the establishment of defined reference intervals, and implementation of round-robin trials. One major problem, the lack of compliance sometimes seen in outpatient saliva donors, requires strict standardization of both collection and analysis methods to achieve better comparability and assessment of published salivary hormone data.},

The Allostatic Load Index (ALI) has been used to establish associations between stress and health-related outcomes. This review summarizes the measurement and methodological challenges of allostatic load in occupational settings. Databases of Medline, PubPsych, and Cochrane were searched to systematically explore studies measuring ALI in working adults following the PRISMA statement. Study characteristics, biomarkers and methods were tabulated. Methodological quality was evaluated using a standardized checklist. Sixteen articles (2003–2013) met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 39 (range 6–17) different variables used to calculate ALI. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in the number and type of biomarkers used, the analytic techniques applied and study quality. Particularly, primary mediators were not regularly included in ALI calculation. Consensus on methods to measure ALI in working populations is limited. Research should include longitudinal studies using multi-systemic variables to measure employees at risk for biological wear and tear.},

abstract = {From ancient Greece to nowadays, research on posture control was guided and shaped by many concepts. Equilibrium control is often considered part of postural control. However, two different levels have become increasingly apparent in the postural control system, one level sets a distribution of tonic muscle activity ("posture") and the other is assigned to compensate for internal or external perturbations ("equilibrium"). While the two levels are inherently interrelated, both neurophysiological and functional considerations point toward distinct neuromuscular underpinnings. Disturbances of muscle tone may in turn affect movement performance. The unique structure, specialization and properties of skeletal muscles should also be taken into account for understanding important peripheral contributors to postural regulation. Here, we will consider the neuromechanical basis of habitual posture and various concepts that were rather influential in many experimental studies and mathematical models of human posture control.},

@article{Mulligan2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Concussion management practices are important for athlete safety. Baseline testing provides a benchmark to which post-injury assessments are compared. Yet few neurophysical concussion assessment studies have examined learned response. The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) measures postural stability through 6 conditions by counting the errors committed during each condition. In a study examining the performance of high school-aged athletes on the BESS, the learned response extinguished in 3 weeks. However, this phenomenon has not been studied in the college-aged population. HYPOTHESIS College-aged adults performing the BESS will have a learned response at 1 and 2 weeks but would have no change from baseline at or after 3 weeks, as found previously in high school-aged subjects. STUDY DESIGN Randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS Three groups of college-aged adults ages 18 to 26 years were tested using the BESS at scheduled intervals. Each subject was randomly assigned into 1 of 3 groups to determine learned response at weeks 1, 2, and 4. Changes in pretest and posttest BESS scores were compared using the paired t test for each group at week 4 and other intervals. Differences among groups were compared using analysis of variance for means or the chi-square test for proportions. RESULTS After 4 weeks, participants exhibited a mean (95{\%} confidence interval) change from pretest baseline of -2.30 (-4.75, 0.16) in the control group (P = 0.065), -3.13 (-4.84, -1.41) in Group 1 (P = 0.001), and -2.57 (-5.28, 0.15) in Group 2 (P = 0.063). There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups for week 4 BESS score (P = 0.291) or changes from baseline to week 4 BESS scores (P = 0.868). Overall, participant score changes from baseline to the 4-week follow-up still showed a statistically significant or close to significant reduction across the 3 groups, indicating the learned response did not extinguish after 4 weeks. CONCLUSION Repeated BESS testing results in a learned effect in college-aged adults did not extinguish after 4 weeks. These results question the ability of the BESS to assess an athlete's balance deficits following a concussion. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Given learned response did not extinguish in this sample and the BESS has a minimal detectable change/reliable change index of 7 or greater, the effectiveness of the BESS to assess balance may be limited.},

@article{Kumar2001,
abstract = {Based on the scientific evidence in published literature about precipitation of musculoskeletal injuries in the workplace, four theories have been proposed to explain these afflictions. Central to all theories is the presupposition that all occupational musculoskeletal injuries are biomechanical in nature. Disruption of mechanical order of a biological system is dependent on the individual components and their mechanical properties. These common denominators will be causally affected by the individual's genetic endowment, morphological characteristics and psychosocial makeup, and by the occupational biomechanical hazards. This phenomenon is explained by the Multivariate Interaction Theory. Differential Fatigue Theory accounts for unbalanced and asymmetric occupational activities creating differential fatigue and thereby a kinetic and kinematic imbalance resulting in injury precipitation. Cumulative Load Theory suggests a threshold range of load and repetition product beyond which injury precipitates, as all material substances have a finite life. Finally, Overexertion Theory claims that exertion exceeding the tolerance limit precipitates occupational musculoskeletal injury. It is also suggested that while these theories may explain the immediate mechanism of precipitation of injuries, they all operate simultaneously and interact to modulate injuries to varying degrees in different cases.},

abstract = {Study Design Controlled laboratory study; prospective. Background Postural stability deficits during single-leg stance have been reported in persons with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, ACL reconstruction, and chronic ankle instability. It remains unclear whether impaired postural stability is a consequence or cause of these injuries. Objectives To prospectively investigate whether postural stability deficits during single-leg stance predict non-contact lower extremity injuries. Methods Fifty injury-free female athletes performed a transition task from double-leg stance to single-leg stance with eyes closed. The center of pressure (COP) displacement during the first 3 seconds after the time to new stability point (TAT) was reached during single-leg stance (COP TAT) was the main outcome variable. Non-contact lower extremity injuries were recorded during a 1-year follow-up. Results Six participants sustained a non-contact ACL injury or ankle sprain. COP TAT was significantly increased in the injured (P=0.030) and non-injured leg (P=0.009) of the injured group compared to the respective matched leg of the non-injured group. The area under the receiving operating characteristic curve analysis (AUC) revealed significant discriminative accuracy between groups for COP TAT of the injured (AUC=0.814; P=0.015) and non-injured leg (AUC=0.897; P=0.004) of the injured group with the matched leg of the non-injured group. Conclusion Postural stability measurements during the single-leg stance phase of the double-leg stance to single-leg stance transition task may is suggestive of increased risk of non-contact lower extremity injury.

abstract = {Purpose: This study was conducted to compare R–R intervals and the subsequent analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) obtained from the Polar S810 heart rate monitor (HRM) (Polar Electro Oy) with an electrocardiogram (ECG) (Physiotrace, Estaris, Lille, France) during an orthostatic test. Methods: A total of 18 healthy men (age: 27.1 T 1.9 yr; height: 1.82 T 0.06 m; mass 77.1 T 7.7 kg) performed an active orthostatic test during which R–R intervals were simultaneously recorded with the HRM and the ECG recorder The two signals were synchronized and corrected before a time domain analysis, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and a Poincare ´ plot analysis. Bias and limits of agreement (LoA), effect size (ES), and correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: R–R intervals were significantly different in the supine and standing position between the ECG and the HRM uncorrected and corrected signal (P G 0.05, ES = 0.000 and 0.006, respectively). The bias T LoA, however, were 0.9 T 12 ms. HRV parameters derived from both signals in both positions were not different (P {\textgreater} 0.05) and well correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.97, P G 0.05), except root mean square of difference (RMSSD) and SD1 in standing position (P G 0.05, ES = 0.052 and 0.057; r = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Conclusion: Narrow LoA, good correlations, and small effect sizes support the validity of the Polar S810 HRM to measure R–R intervals and make the subsequent HRV analysis in supine position. Caution must be taken in standing position for the parameters sensitive to the short-term variability (i.e., RMSSD and SD1).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sensation seeking is closely related to practicing high-risk sports. This domain offers individuals an opportunity to achieve an increased level of arousal. Moreover, stress reactivity implies interindividual differences in the capacity to respond to a stressor. The purpose of this study was to examine whether high sensation seekers (HSS) compared to low sensation seekers (LSS) experience lower levels of stress on a physiological and psychological basis. Stress was induced in a sport-specific experimental paradigm with a climbing task through a jump into the rope. METHODS: Two extreme groups (n = 28 male athletes) were examined in a mixed-factorial design (between: HSS vs. LSS; within: repeated measurements of several variables related to stress reactivity - cortisol, heart rate, anxiety). RESULTS: In response to the stressor HSS compared to LSS released a significantly lower amount of cortisol and needed less time for the climbing task. Heart rate and anxiety were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals seem to react physiologically differently to a sport-specific stressor, depending on their level of sensation seeking. HSS seem to be less strained, and seem to perform better. These findings might be relevant not only for the evaluation of (sport-) psychological interventions but also for other contexts (e.g., special forces).},

Our review will help coaches, clinical sport professionals, researchers, and athletes better understand how to comprehensively monitor physiologic changes, as they design training cycles that elicit maximal improvements in performance while minimizing overtraining and injury risk.},

OBJECTIVE To report the epidemiology of overuse injuries sustained by collegiate athletes and to compare the rates of overuse and acute injuries. DESIGN Descriptive epidemiology study. SETTING A National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I university. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS A total of 1317 reported injuries sustained by 573 male and female athletes in 16 collegiate sports teams during the 2005-2008 seasons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) The injury and athlete-exposure (AE) data were obtained from the Sports Injury Monitoring System. An injury was coded as either overuse or acute based on the nature of injury. Injury rate was calculated as the total number of overuse (or acute) injuries during the study period divided by the total number of AEs during the same period. RESULTS A total of 386 (29.3{\%}) overuse injuries and 931 (70.7{\%}) acute injuries were reported. The overall injury rate was 63.1 per 10 000 AEs. The rate ratio (RR) of acute versus overuse injuries was 2.34 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 2.05, 2.67). Football had the highest RR (RR = 8.35, 95{\%} CI = 5.38, 12.97), and women's rowing had the lowest (RR = 0.75, 95{\%} CI = 0.51, 1.10). Men had a higher acute injury rate than women (49.8 versus 38.6 per 10 000 AEs). Female athletes had a higher rate of overuse injury than male athletes (24.6 versus 13.2 per 10,000 AEs). More than half of the overuse injuries (50.8{\%}) resulted in no time loss from sport. CONCLUSIONS Additional studies are needed to examine why female athletes are at greater risk for overuse injuries and identify the best practices for prevention and rehabilitation of overuse injuries.},

abstract = {To determine the salivary steroid response to high-intensity functional training (HIFT) competition workouts, saliva samples were collected from ten recreationally trained male and female competitors during a 5-week (WK1–WK5) international competition. Competitors arrived at their local affiliate and provided samples prior to (PRE) their warm-up, immediately (IP), 30-min (30P), and 60-min (60P) post-exercise. Samples were analyzed for concentrations of testosterone (T), cortisol (C), and their ratio (TC). Generalized linear mixed models with repeated measures revealed significant main effects for time (p {\textless} 0.001) for T, C, and TC. Compared to PRE-concentrations, elevated (p {\textless} 0.05) T was observed at IP on WK2–WK5 (mean difference: 135–511 pg{\textperiodcentered}mL−1), at 30P on WK3 (mean difference: 81.0 ± 30.1 pg{\textperiodcentered}mL−1) and WK5 (mean difference: 56.6 ± 22.7 pg{\textperiodcentered}mL−1), and at 60P on WK3 (mean difference: 73.5 ± 29.7 pg{\textperiodcentered}mL−1) and WK5 (mean difference: 74.3 ± 28.4 pg{\textperiodcentered}mL−1). Compared to PRE-concentrations, elevated (p {\textless} 0.05) C was noted on all weeks at IP (mean difference: 9.3–15.9 ng{\textperiodcentered}mL−1) and 30P (mean difference: 6.0–19.9 ng{\textperiodcentered}mL−1); significant (p {\textless} 0.006) elevations were noted at 60P on WK1 (mean difference: 9.1 ± 3.0 ng{\textperiodcentered}mL−1) and WK5 (mean difference: 12.8 ± 2.9 ng{\textperiodcentered}mL−1). Additionally, TC was significantly reduced from PRE-values by 61{\%} on WK1 at 60P (p = 0.040) and by 80{\%} on WK5 at 30P (p = 0.023). Differences in T, C, and TC were also observed between weeks at specific time points. Although each workout affected concentrations in T, C, and/or the TC ratio, changes appeared to be modulated by the presence of overload and workout duration. During periods of elevated training or competition, athletes and coaches may consider monitoring these hormones for consistency and as a means of assessing workout difficulty.},

abstract = {The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model and update it with recent results. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis of recent neuroimaging studies on the relationship between heart rate variability and regional cerebral blood flow. We identified a number of regions, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in which significant associations across studies were found. We further propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. Heart rate variability may provide an index of how strongly 'top-down' appraisals, mediated by cortical-subcortical pathways, shape brainstem activity and autonomic responses in the body. If the default response to uncertainty is the threat response, as we propose here, contextual information represented in 'appraisal' systems may be necessary to overcome this bias during daily life. Thus, HRV may serve as a proxy for 'vertical integration' of the brain mechanisms that guide flexible control over behavior with peripheral physiology, and as such provides an important window into understanding stress and health. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hu2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND In clinical trials of behavioral health interventions, outcome variables often take the form of counts, such as days using substances or episodes of unprotected sex. Classically, count data follow a Poisson distribution; however, in practice such data often display greater heterogeneity in the form of excess zeros (zero-inflation) or greater spread in the values (overdispersion) or both. Greater sample heterogeneity may be especially common in community-based effectiveness trials, where broad eligibility criteria are implemented to achieve a generalizable sample. OBJECTIVES This article reviews the characteristics of Poisson model and the related models that have been developed to handle overdispersion (negative binomial (NB) model) or zero-inflation (zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and Poisson hurdle (PH) models) or both (zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) and negative binomial hurdle (NBH) models). METHODS All six models were used to model the effect of an HIV-risk reduction intervention on the count of unprotected sexual occasions (USOs), using data from a previously completed clinical trial among female patients (N = 515) participating in community-based substance abuse treatment (Tross et al. Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS sexual risk reduction groups for women in substance abuse treatment programs: Results of NIDA Clinical Trials Network Trial. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 2008; 48(5):581-589). Goodness of fit and the estimates of treatment effect derived from each model were compared. RESULTS The ZINB model provided the best fit, yielding a medium-sized effect of intervention. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE This article illustrates the consequences of applying models with different distribution assumptions on the data. If a model used does not closely fit the shape of the data distribution, the estimate of the effect of the intervention may be biased, either over- or underestimating the intervention effect.},

abstract = {Injury aetiology models that have evolved over the previous two decades highlight a number of factors which contribute to the causal mechanisms for athletic injuries. These models highlight the pathway to injury, including (1) internal risk factors (eg, age, neuromuscular control) which predispose athletes to injury, (2) exposure to external risk factors (eg, playing surface, equipment), and finally (3) an inciting event, wherein biomechanical breakdown and injury occurs. The most recent aetiological model proposed in 2007 was the first to detail the dynamic nature of injury risk, whereby participation may or may not result in injury, and participation itself alters injury risk through adaptation. However, although training and competition workloads are strongly associated with injury, existing aetiology models neither include them nor provide an explanation for how workloads alter injury risk. Therefore, we propose an updated injury aetiology model which includes the effects of workloads. Within this model, internal risk factors are differentiated into modifiable and non-modifiable factors, and workloads contribute to injury in three ways: (1) exposure to external risk factors and potential inciting events, (2) fatigue, or negative physiological effects, and (3) fitness, or positive physiological adaptations. Exposure is determined solely by total load, while positive and negative adaptations are controlled both by total workloads, as well as changes in load (eg, the acute:chronic workload ratio). Finally, we describe how this model explains the load-injury relationships for total workloads, acute:chronic workload ratios and the training load-injury paradox.},

abstract = {This article describes the development of a new instrument, the Life Experi-ences Survey, for the measurement of life changes. It was designed to eliminate certain shortcomings of previous life stress measures and allows for separate assessment of positive and negative life experiences as well as individualized ratings of the impact of events. Several studies bearing on the usefulness of the Life Experiences Survey are presented, and the implications of the findings are discussed. During recent years, numerous studies have investigated the relationship between life stress and susceptibility to physical and psy-chological problems. Most of these studies have been based on the assumptions that (a) life changes require adaptation on the part of the individual and are stressful, and (b) persons experiencing marked degrees of life change during the recent past are susceptible to physical and psychiatric problems. There is considerable evidence that a re-lationship exists between life stress, opera-tionally defined in terms of self-reported life changes, and physical illness (Dohrenwcnd {\&} Dohrenwend, 1974b). Rahe and Lind (1971) have reported a relationship between life stress and sudden cardiac death. Theorcll and Rahe (1971) and Edwards (1971) have provided data suggestive of a link between life stress and myocardial infarction.

We report the development and validation of a questionnaire measure of the revised reinforcement sensitivity theory (rRST) of personality. Starting with qualitative responses to defensive and approach scenarios modeled on typical rodent ethoexperimental situations, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) revealed a robust 6-factor structure: 2 unitary defensive factors, fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS; related to fear) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS; related to anxiety); and 4 behavioral approach system (BAS) factors (Reward Interest, Goal-Drive Persistence, Reward Reactivity, and Impulsivity). Theoretically motivated thematic facets were employed to sample the breadth of defensive space, comprising FFFS (Flight, Freeze, and Active Avoidance) and BIS (Motor Planning Interruption, Worry, Obsessive Thoughts, and Behavioral Disengagement). Based on theoretical considerations, and statistically confirmed, a separate scale for Defensive Fight was developed. Validation evidence for the 6-factor structure came from convergent and discriminant validity shown by correlations with existing personality scales. We offer the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality Questionnaire to facilitate future research specifically on rRST and, more broadly, on approach-avoidance theories of personality.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesize that increased heart rate (HR) and decreased heart rate variability (HRV) are not only due to concurrent stressful events and worries but also to stressors and worries occurring in the preceding hours or stressors anticipated to occur in the next hour. Worry was expected to mediate at least part of the prolonged effects of stressors. METHODS: Ambulatory HR and HRV of 73 teachers were recorded for 4 days, during which the participants reported occurrence and duration of worry episodes and stressful events on an hourly basis, using computerized diaries. Multilevel regression models were used, accounting for effects of several biobehavioral variables. RESULTS: Stressful events were not associated with changes in HR or HRV. However, worry episodes had effects on concurrent HR and HRV (2.55 beats/minute; -5.76 milliseconds) and HR and HRV in the succeeding hour (3.05 beats/minute; -5.80 milliseconds) and 2 hours later (1.52 beats/minute; -3.14 milliseconds). These findings were independent of emotions, physical activity, posture, and other biobehavioral factors. CONCLUSION: Worry has effects on cardiac activity, and these effects were still visible after 2 hours. The latter finding suggests that a considerable part of prolonged activation may be induced by unconscious stress-related cognition.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine. Background: Multivariate analysis that identifies the combination of risk factors associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) trauma is important because it provides insight into whether a variable has a direct causal effect on risk or an indirect effect that is mediated by other variables. It can also reveal risk factors that might not be evident in univariate analyses; if a variable's effect is moderated by other variables, its association with risk may be apparent only after adjustment for the other variables. Most important, multivariate analyses can identify combinations of risk factors that are more predictive of risk than individual risk factors. Hypothesis: A diverse combination of risk factors predispose athletes to first-time noncontact ACL injury, and these relationships are different for male and female athletes. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Athletes competing in organized sports at the high school and college levels participated in this study. Data from injured subjects (109 suffering an ACL injury) and matched controls (227 subjects) from the same athletic team were analyzed with multivariate conditional logistic regression to examine the effects of combinations of variables (demographic characteristics, joint laxity, lower extremity alignment, strength, and personality traits) on the risk of suffering their first ACL injury and to construct risk models. Results: For male athletes, increases in anterior-posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur (knee laxity), posterior knee stiffness, navicular drop, and a decrease in standing quadriceps angle were jointly predictive of suffering an ACL injury. For female athletes the combined effects of having a parent who had suffered an ACL injury and increases in anterior-posterior knee laxity and body mass index were predictive of ACL injury. Conclusion: Multivariate models provided more information about ACL injury risk than individual risk factors. Both male and female risk models included increased anterior-posterior knee laxity as a predictor of ACL injury but were otherwise dissimilar.},

MAIN RESULTS: Only 144 of 2525 articles retrieved by the search strategy met the inclusion criteria. Crossover study designs increased by 175{\%} in the late 1980s until 2005 but have declined 32{\%} since then. Randomised controlled trial (RCT) study designs increased by 650{\%} since the early 1980s. Protective equipment studies (61.8{\%} of all studies) declined by 35{\%} since 2000, and training studies (35.4{\%} of all studies) increased by 213{\%}. Equipment research studied stability devices (83.1{\%}) and attenuating devices (13.5{\%}) whereas training research studied balance and coordination (54.9{\%}), strength and power (43.1{\%}) and stretching (15.7{\%}). Almost all (92.1{\%}) studies investigated the lower extremity and 78.1{\%} were of the joint (non-bone)-ligament type. Finally, 57.5{\%} of the reports studied contact sports, 24.2{\%} collision and 25.8{\%} non-contact sports. CONCLUSION: The decrease in crossover study design and increase in RCTs over time suggest a shift in study design for injury prevention articles. Another notable finding was the change in research focus from equipment interventions, which have been decreasing since 2000 (35{\%} decline), to training interventions, which have been increasing (213{\%} increase). Finally, there is very little research on overuse or upper extremity injuries.},

abstract = {Objective To quantify resting lumbar erector myofascial stiffness in younger patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and age-comparable healthy control subjects using a handheld mechanical impulse-based myotonometric device. Design A case-control study of 24 patients with AS and 24 age-comparable healthy control subjects. Setting University physical therapy department. Participants Patients with AS (men: n=19; women: n=5; total: N=24) and healthy volunteers (men: n=19; women: n=5; total: N=24) without low back pain (age range, 18-46y). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure Lumbar myofascial stiffness. Results At the initial measurements, median stiffness (Nm) of the averaged right- and left-sided values was greater (P=.021) in 24 patients with AS than 24 control subjects (268.9 vs 238.9, respectively). Repeated measurements after a 10-minute prone resting period were also greater (P=.007) in patients with AS than control subjects (281.0 vs 241.4, respectively). The 48 averaged right- and left-sided values from baseline and 10-minute measurements were compared in each subject group. The patients with AS more frequently (P=.012) had stiffness values {\textgreater}250Nm (35 [72.9{\%}] vs 22 [45.8{\%}] in control subjects). Conclusions Lumbar myofascial stiffness was greater in 24 patients with AS than in the control subjects. A hypothesized biomechanical concept of increased resting lumbar myofascial stiffness in AS may be supported by this preliminary controlled study.},

Predicting risk for ankle injury could be important in helping to reduce the risk of these injuries and furthermore save health care costs.$\backslash$nDESIGN: Cohort study.$\backslash$nSETTING: Data were collected at five high schools during the first 2 weeks of the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 basketball seasons.$\backslash$nSUBJECTS: 210 (119 male, age = 16.1 +/- 1.1 yr; height = 182.98 +/- 7.4 cm; weight = 76.4 +/- 10.9 kg; and 91 female, age = 16.3 +/- 1.3 yr; height = 170.9 +/- 7.8 cm; weight = 63.4 +/- 8.4 kg) high school basketball players who did not sustain a time loss ankle or knee injury within the previous 12 months served as subjects. Subjects did not use prophylactic ankle taping or bracing during the season.$\backslash$nASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS: Balance was quantified from postural sway scores measured while subjects performed unilateral balance tests with eyes both open and closed. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine if gender, dominant leg, and balance scores were related to ankle sprain injuries. In addition, Fischer's exact test was used to determine if the rate of ankle injuries was the same whether the subject had poor, average, or good balance. Balance was assessed by measuring postural sway with the NeuroCom New Balance Master version 6.0 (NeuroCom International, Clackamas, OR, U.S.A.). Testing to determine postural sway consisted of having subjects stand on one leg for three trials of 10 seconds with their eyes open, then repeated with their eyes closed. Subjects then underwent the same assessment while standing on the other leg. Postural sway was defined as the average degrees of sway per second (degrees S/S) for the 12 trials producing a compilation (COMP) score.$\backslash$nOUTCOME MEASURES: Ankle injury resulting in missed participation.$\backslash$nRESULTS: Subjects who sustained ankle sprains had a preseason COMP score of 2.01 +/- 0.32 (Mean +/- SD), while athletes who did not sustain ankle injuries had a score of 1.74 +/- 0.31. Higher postural sway scores corresponded to increased ankle sprain injury rates (p = 0.001). Subjects who demonstrated poor balance (high sway scores) had nearly seven times as many ankle sprains as subjects who had good balance (low sway scores) (p = 0.0002.)$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In this cohort of high school basketball players, pre-season balance measurement (postural sway) served as a predictor of ankle sprain susceptibility.},

abstract = {A key step in implementing Bayesian networks (BNs) is the discretization of continuous variables. There are several mathematical methods for constructing discrete distributions, the implications of which on the resulting model has not been discussed in literature. Discretization invariably results in loss of information, and both the discretization method and the number of intervals determines the level of such loss. We designed an experiment to evaluate the impact of commonly used discretization methods and number of intervals on the developed BNs. The conditional probability tables, model predictions, and management recommendations were compared and shown to be different among models. However, none of the models did uniformly well in all comparison criteria. As we cannot justify using one discretization method against others, we recommend caution when discretization is used, and a verification process that includes evaluating alternative methods to ensure that the conclusions are not an artifact of the discretization approach.},

Thirty-one participants underwent weekly rebound jump testing on a force platform over two seasons. Vertical stiffness was calculated for injured players and the uninjured cohort 1 and 3 weeks prior to sustaining an injury and at the end of preseason. Eighteen athletes were in the "uninjured" cohort and 13 in the "injured" cohort. No significant difference in vertical stiffness was observed between groups (P = 0.18 for absolute stiffness; P = 0.08 for stiffness relative to body mass), within groups (P = 0.83 and P = 0.88, respectively) or for a time*cohort interaction (P = 0.77 and P = 0.80, respectively). No relationship between age and vertical stiffness existed (r = -0.06 for absolute and relative stiffness), or training history and vertical stiffness (r = -0.01 and 0.00 for absolute and relative stiffness, respectively) existed. These results and others lend to suggest that vertical stiffness is not related to lower limb muscle strain injury.},

abstract = {This systematic review investigates the acute ef- fects of physical or psychosocial interventions on testosterone and cortisol responses in elite male rugby union players, and the subsequent association with physical performance areas (e.g., strength, power, sprint performance) or key performance indicators (e.g., coach-identified skills). Medline (via EBSCO), SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, InformIT, ProQuest, Co- chrane, and Scopus were searched for relevant articles. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria, with 6 articles examining the effect of speed, strength or power training, and the remaining 3 psychosocial interventions. Quality assessment of the articles as determined by their PEDro score was either 6 or 7 out of 11. This review found that both physical and psychosocial inter- ventions can alter testosterone and cortisol, and physical per- formance areas important for rugby union are affected by these changes. The limited literature in the field supports the notion that physical interventions of short duration and high intensity, and psychosocial interventions that create a positive environ- ment may elicit a hormonal response that is associated with favorable performance outcomes. Studies that reported psy- chosocial interventions suggest that testosterone and cortisol may be altered in elite rugby players without metabolic stress, something of great interest to elite athletes and coaches whoare lookingtoelicitaperformance advantage without increasing athlete load. Overall, this review identified that when the testosterone responses to an intervention are notably greater than that of cortisol, favorable outcomes are likely. Further research is required to improve our under- standing on how to best manipulate training to induce these favorable changes.},

Thirty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to the intra-session reliability (n = 20), inter-day reliability (n = 21) and the inter-observer reliability (n = 16) experiments. Muscle shear elastic modulus ranged from 2.99 (gastrocnemius medialis) to 4.50 kPa (adductor digiti minimi and tibialis anterior). On the whole, very good reliability was observed, with a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 4.6{\%} to 8{\%}, except for the inter-operator reliability of adductor pollicis obliquus (CV = 11.5{\%}). The intraclass correlation coefficients were good (0.871 +/- 0.045 for the intra-session reliability, 0.815 +/- 0.065 for the inter-day reliability and 0.709 +/- 0.141 for the inter-observer reliability). Both the reliability and the ease of use of SSI make it a potentially interesting technique that would be of benefit to fundamental, applied and clinical research projects that need an accurate assessment of muscle mechanical properties.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the change in the time intervals between adjacent heartbeats, is an emergent property of interdependent regulatory systems that operate on different time scales to adapt to challenges and achieve optimal performance. This article briefly reviews neural regulation of the heart, and its basic anatomy, the cardiac cycle, and the sinoatrial and atrioventricular pacemakers. The cardiovascular regulation center in the medulla integrates sensory information and input from higher brain centers, and afferent cardiovascular system inputs to adjust heart rate and blood pressure via sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent pathways. This article reviews sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the heart, and examines the interpretation of HRV and the association between reduced HRV, risk of disease and mortality, and the loss of regulatory capacity. This article also discusses the intrinsic cardiac nervous system and the heart-brain connection, through which afferent information can influence activity in the subcortical and frontocortical areas, and motor cortex. It also considers new perspectives on the putative underlying physiological mechanisms and properties of the ultra-low-frequency (ULF), very-low-frequency (VLF), low-frequency (LF), and high-frequency (HF) bands. Additionally, it reviews the most common time and frequency domain measurements as well as standardized data collection protocols. In its final section, this article integrates Porges' polyvagal theory, Thayer and colleagues' neurovisceral integration model, Lehrer et al.'s resonance frequency model, and the Institute of HeartMath's coherence model. The authors conclude that a coherent heart is not a metronome because its rhythms are characterized by both complexity and stability over longer time scales. Future research should expand understanding of how the heart and its intrinsic nervous system influence the brain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Physical or mental imbalance caused by harmful stimuli can induce stress to maintain homeostasis. During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. METHODS Term searches in the Web of Science{\textregistered}, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. RESULTS In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Anxiety disorders increase risk of future cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, even after controlling for confounds including smoking, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status, and irrespective of a history of medical disorders. While impaired vagal function, indicated by reductions in heart rate variability (HRV), may be one mechanism linking anxiety disorders to CVD, prior studies have reported inconsistent findings highlighting the need for meta-analysis. METHOD Studies comparing resting-state HRV recordings in patients with an anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis and healthy controls were considered for meta-analysis. RESULTS Meta-analyses were based on 36 articles, including 2086 patients with an anxiety disorder and 2294 controls. Overall, anxiety disorders were characterized by lower HRV [high frequency (HF): Hedges' g = -0.29. 95{\%} CI: -0.41 to -0.17, p {\textless} 0.001; time domain: Hedges' g = -0.45, 95{\%} CI: -0.57 to -0.33, p {\textless} 0.001] than controls. Panic disorder (n = 447), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 192), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 68), and social anxiety disorder (n = 90), but not obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 40), displayed reductions in HF HRV relative to controls (all ps {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {We have previously reported that state anxiety scores were positively correlated with postural sway while standing upright and gazing at a visual target (Ohno et al., 2004 [16]). The present study examines the effect of anticipatory anxiety and visual input on postural control in healthy individuals. An unpredictable aversive sound (100. dB SPL) was delivered in order to induce anticipatory anxiety. Participants were asked to stand upright on a force plate with their eyes open and closed, and their center of pressure (COP) was measured. Analysis of the postural parameters revealed that the path lengths of the COP and the enveloped areas were greater in the anticipatory situation with the aversive sound than in the silent situation. Fast Fourier transform analysis showed that the frequency component related to vestibular inputs (0.1-1.0. Hz) was increased during the anticipatory situation. The lower frequency ({\textless}0.1. Hz) component was decreased in the medio-lateral axis during anticipation with the eyes closed due to shifting mean power frequencies to high frequency. The results suggest that anticipatory anxiety in healthy participants amplified the sway regardless of whether the eyes were open or closed, and that the vestibular inputs greatly influenced the amplification of postural sway. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {There are common pathways by which psychological stress and exercise stress alter immunity. However, it remains unknown whether psychological stress plays a role in the in vivo immune response to exercise. We examined the relationship between anxiety and perceived psychological stress reported before exercise and in vivo immunity after exercise using skin sensitisation with Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP). In a randomised design, sixty four, thoroughly familiarised, males completed widely used psychological instruments to assess state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress before exercise, and ran either 30 minutes at 60{\%} (30MI) or 80{\%} (30HI) V . O2peak, 120 minutes at 60{\%} (120MI) V . O2peak or rested (CON) before DPCP sensitisation. Cutaneous recall to DPCP was measured as the dermal thickening response to a low-dose series DPCP challenge 4-weeks after sensitisation. After accounting for exercise (R2 = 0.20; P {\textless} 0.01), multiple-regression showed that pre-exercise state-anxiety (STAI-S; DeltaR2 = 0.19; P {\textless} 0.01) and perceived psychological stress (DeltaR2 = 0.13; P {\textless} 0.05) were moderately associated with the DPCP response after exercise. The STAI-S scores before exercise were considered low-to-moderate in these familiarised individuals (median split; mean STAI-S of low 25 and moderate 34). Further examination showed that the DPCP response after exercise (30MI, 30HI or 120MI) was 62{\%} lower in those reporting low vs. moderate state-anxiety before exercise (mean difference in dermal thickening: -2.6 mm; 95{\%} CI: -0.8 to -4.4 mm; P {\textless} 0.01). As such, the results indicate a beneficial effect of moderate (vs. low) state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress on in vivo immunity after exercise. Moreover, correlations were of comparable strength for the relationship between physiological stress (heart rate training impulse) and the summed dermal response to DPCP (r = -0.37; 95{\%} CI: -0.05 to -0.62; P = 0.01), and state-anxiety and the summed dermal response to DPCP (r = 0.39; 95{\%} CI: 0.08 to 0.63; P {\textless} 0.01). In conclusion, state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress levels before exercise play animportant role in determining the strength of the in vivo immune response after exercise. These findings indicate a similar strength relationship for the level of state-anxiety prior to exercise and the level of physiological stress during exercise with the in vivo immune response after exercise. Future research is required to investigate exercise-immune responses in athletes, military personnel and others in physically demanding occupations experiencing higher levels of psychological stress than those reported in this study e.g. related to important competition, military operations and major life events. Nevertheless, the present findings support the recommendation that exercise scientists should account for anxiety and psychological stress when examining the immune response to exercise.},

abstract = {One of the main difficulties in the geotechnical design process lies in dealing with uncertainty. Uncertainty is associated with natural variation of properties, and the imprecision and unpredictability caused by insufficient information on parameters or models. Probabilistic methods are normally used to quantify uncertainty. However, the frequentist approach commonly used for this purpose has some drawbacks. First, it lacks a formal framework for incorporating knowledge not represented by data. Second, it has limitations in providing a proper measure of the confidence of parameters inferred from data. The Bayesian approach offers a better framework for treating uncertainty in geotechnical design. The advantages of the Bayesian approach for uncertainty quantification are highlighted in this paper with the Bayesian regression analysis of laboratory test data to infer the intact rock strength parameters $\sigma$ci and mi used in the Hoek–Brown strength criterion. Two case examples are used to illustrate different aspects of the Bayesian methodology and to contrast the approach with a frequentist approach represented by the nonlinear least squares (NLLS) method. The paper discusses the use of a Student's t-distribution versus a normal distribution to handle outliers, the consideration of absolute versus relative residuals, and the comparison of quality of fitting results based on standard errors and Bayes factors. Uncertainty quantification with confidence and prediction intervals of the frequentist approach is compared with that based on scatter plots and bands of fitted envelopes of the Bayesian approach. Finally, the Bayesian method is extended to consider two improvements of the fitting analysis. The first is the case in which the Hoek–Brown parameter, a, is treated as a variable to improve the fitting in the triaxial region. The second is the incorporation of the uncertainty in the estimation of the direct tensile strength from Brazilian test results within the overall evaluation of the intact rock strength.},

Existing studies in the literature provide just a preliminary understanding of which factors mostly affect injury risk, while an evaluation of the potential of statistical models in forecasting injuries is still missing. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional approach to injury forecasting in professional soccer that is based on GPS measurements and machine learning. By using GPS tracking technology, we collect data describing the training workload of players in a professional soccer club during a season. We then construct an injury forecaster and show that it is both accurate and interpretable by providing a set of case studies of interest to soccer practitioners. Our approach opens a novel perspective on injury prevention, providing a set of simple and practical rules for evaluating and interpreting the complex relations between injury risk and training performance in professional soccer.},

abstract = {Stress-injury models of health suggest that athletes experience more physical injuries during times of high stress. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of increased physical and academic stress on injury restrictions for athletes (n=101) on a Division I college football team. Weeks of the season were categorized into three levels: high physical stress (i.e., preseason), high academic stress (i.e., weeks with regularly scheduled examinations such as midterms, finals, and week before Thanksgiving break), and low academic stress (i.e., regular season without regularly scheduled academic examinations). During each week, we recorded whether a player had an injury restriction or not, thereby creating a longitudinal binary outcome. The data was analyzed using a hierarchical logistic regression model to properly account for the dependency induced by the repeated observations over time within each subject. Significance for regression models was accepted at p{\textless}0.05. We found that the odds of an injury restriction during training camp (high physical stress) were greatest compared to weeks of high academic stress (OR=2.05, p=0.0003) and low academic stress (OR=3.65, p{\textless}0.001). However, the odds of an injury restriction during weeks of high academic stress were nearly twice as high than during weeks of low academic stress (OR=1.78, p=0.0088). Moreover, the difference in injury rates reported in all athletes during weeks of high physical stress and weeks of high academic stress disappeared when considering only athletes that regularly played in games (OR=1.13, p=0.75), suggesting that high academic stress may affect athletes that play to an even greater extent than high physical stress. Coaches should be aware of both types of stressors and consider carefully the types of training methods imposed during times of high academic stress, when injuries are most likely.},

abstract = {Injury prediction is one of the most challenging issues in sports and a key component for injury prevention. Sports injuries aetiology investigations have assumed a reductionist view in which a phenomenon has been simplified into units and analysed as the sum of its basic parts and causality has been seen in a linear and unidirectional way. This reductionist approach relies on correlation and regression analyses and, despite the vast effort to predict sports injuries, it has been limited in its ability to successfully identify predictive factors. The majority of human health conditions are complex. In this sense, the multifactorial complex nature of sports injuries arises not from the linear interaction between isolated and predictive factors, but from the complex interaction among a web of determinants. Thus, the aim of this conceptual paper was to propose a complex system model for sports injuries and to demonstrate how the implementation of complex system thinking may allow us to better address the complex nature of the sports injuries aetiology. According to this model, we should identify features that are hallmarks of complex systems, such as the pattern of relationships (interactions) among determinants, the regularities (profiles) that simultaneously characterise and constrain the phenomenon and the emerging pattern that arises from the complex web of determinants. In sports practice, this emerging pattern may be related to injury occurrence or adaptation. This novel view of preventive intervention relies on the identification of regularities or risk profile, moving from risk factors to risk pattern recognition.},

abstract = {The thoughts and feelings people have about pain (referred to as ‘pain expectations') are known to alter the perception of pain. However little is known about the cognitive processes that underpin pain expectations, or what drives the differing effect that pain expectations have between individuals. This paper details the testing of a model of pain perception which formalises the response to pain in terms of a Bayesian prior-to-posterior updating process. Using data acquired from a short and deception-free predictive cue task, it was found that this Bayesian model predicted ratings of pain better than other, simpler models. At the group level, the results confirmed two core predictions of predictive coding; that expectation alters perception, and that increased uncertainty in the expectation reduces its impact on perception. The addition of parameters relating to trait differences in pain expectation improved the fit of the model, suggesting that such traits play a significant role in perception above and beyond the influence of expectations triggered by predictive cues. When the model parameters were allowed to vary by participant, the model's fit improved further. This final model produced a characterisation of each individual's sensitivity to pain expectations. This model is relevant for the understanding of the cognitive basis of pain expectations and could potentially act as a useful tool for guiding patient stratification and clinical experimentation.},

Objectives The main objectives of these meta-analyses were to examine (i) the effect sizes of relationships between the psychosocial variables (suggested as injury predictors in the model of stress and athletic injury) and injury rates, and (ii) the effects of psychological interven- tions aimed at reducing injury occurrence (prevention). Methods Electronic databases as well as specific sport and exercise psychology journals were searched. The literature review resulted in 48 published studies containing 161 effect sizes for injury prediction and seven effect sizes for injury prevention. Results The results showed that stress responses (r = 0.27, 80 {\%} CI [0.20, 0.33]) and history of stressors (r = 0.13, 80 {\%} CI [0.11, 0.15]) had the strongest associations with injury rates. Also, the results from the path analysis showed that the stress response mediated the relationship between history of stressors and injury rates. For injury prevention studies, all studies included (N = 7) showed decreased injury rates in the treatment groups compared to control groups. Conclusion The results support the model's suggestion that psychosocial variables, as well as psychologically, based interventions, can influence injury risk among athletes. Key},

abstract = {All organisms must maintain a complex dynamic equilibrium, or homeostasis, which is constantly challenged by internal or external adverse forces termed stressors. Stress occurs when homeostasis is threatened or perceived to be so; homeostasis is re-established by various physiological and behavioral adaptive responses. Neuroendocrine hormones have major roles in the regulation of both basal homeostasis and responses to threats, and are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by dyshomeostasis or cacostasis. The stress response is mediated by the stress system, partly located in the central nervous system and partly in peripheral organs. The central, greatly interconnected effectors of this system include the hypothalamic hormones arginine vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone and pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptides, and the locus ceruleus and autonomic norepinephrine centers in the brainstem. Targets of these effectors include the executive and/or cognitive, reward and fear systems, the wake-sleep centers of the brain, the growth, reproductive and thyroid hormone axes, and the gastrointestinal, cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and immune systems. Optimal basal activity and responsiveness of the stress system is essential for a sense of well-being, successful performance of tasks, and appropriate social interactions. By contrast, excessive or inadequate basal activity and responsiveness of this system might impair development, growth and body composition, and lead to a host of behavioral and somatic pathological conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice.

In the example of revascularization choices for diabetic patients who have multivessel coronary artery disease, we combine the results of the FREEDOM trial (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) with prior probability distributions to show how strongly we should believe in the new Class I recommendation ("should be done") for a preference of bypass surgery over percutaneous coronary intervention. In the debate about the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation, we avoid a common pitfall in traditional meta-analysis and create a network of randomized clinical trials to compare outcomes after specific treatment durations. Although we find no credible increase in mortality, we affirm the tradeoff between increased bleeding and reduced myocardial infarctions with prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy, findings that support the new Class IIb recommendation ("may be considered") to extend dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation. In the decision between culprit artery-only and multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, we use hierarchical meta-analysis to analyze evidence from observational studies and randomized clinical trials and find that the probability of all-cause mortality at longest follow-up is similar after both strategies, a finding that challenges the older ban against noninfarct-artery intervention during primary percutaneous coronary intervention. These examples illustrate how Bayesian analysis integrates new trial information with existing knowledge to reduce uncertainty and change attitudes about treatments in cardiovascular medicine.},

abstract = {Background : The analysis of small data sets in longitudinal studies can lead to power issues and often suffers from biased parameter values. These issues can be solved by using Bayesian estimation in conjunction with informative prior distributions. By means of a simulation study and an empirical example concerning posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following mechanical ventilation in burn survivors, we demonstrate the advantages and potential pitfalls of using Bayesian estimation. Methods : First, we show how to specify prior distributions and by means of a sensitivity analysis we demonstrate how to check the exact influence of the prior (mis-) specification. Thereafter, we show by means of a simulation the situations in which the Bayesian approach outperforms the default, maximum likelihood and approach. Finally, we re-analyze empirical data on burn survivors which provided preliminary evidence of an aversive influence of a period of mechanical ventilation on the course of PTSS following burns. Results : Not suprisingly, maximum likelihood estimation showed insufficient coverage as well as power with very small samples. Only when Bayesian analysis, in conjunction with informative priors, was used power increased to acceptable levels. As expected, we showed that the smaller the sample size the more the results rely on the prior specification. Conclusion : We show that two issues often encountered during analysis of small samples, power and biased parameters, can be solved by including prior information into Bayesian analysis. We argue that the use of informative priors should always be reported together with a sensitivity analysis.},

@article{McNaughton2004,
abstract = {We present in this paper a picture of the neural systems controlling defense that updates and simplifies Gray's "Neuropsychology of Anxiety". It is based on two behavioural dimensions: 'defensive distance' as defined by the Blanchards and 'defensive direction'. Defensive direction is a categorical dimension with avoidance of threat corresponding to fear and approach to threat corresponding to anxiety. These two psychological dimensions are mapped to underlying neural dimensions. Defensive distance is mapped to neural level, with the shortest defensive distances involving the lowest neural level (periaqueductal grey) and the largest defensive distances the highest neural level (prefrontal cortex). Defensive direction is mapped to separate parallel streams that run across these levels. A significant departure from prior models is the proposal that both fear and anxiety are represented at all levels. The theory is presented in a simplified form that does not incorporate the interactions that must occur between non-adjacent levels of the system. It also requires expansion to include the dimension of escapability of threat. Our current development and these proposed future extensions do not change the core concepts originally proposed by Gray and, we argue, demonstrate their enduring value. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Bahr2016a,
abstract = {This paper addresses if and how a periodic health examination to screen for risk factors for injury can be used to mitigate injury risk. The key question asked is whether it is possible to use screening tests to identify who is at risk for a sports injury-in order to address the deficit through a targeted intervention programme. The paper demonstrates that to validate a screening test to predict and prevent sports injuries, at least 3 steps are needed. First, a strong relationship needs to be demonstrated in prospective studies between a marker from a screening test and injury risk (step 1). Second, the test properties need to be examined in relevant populations, using appropriate statistical tools (step 2). Unfortunately, there is currently no example of a screening test for sports injuries with adequate test properties. Given the nature of potential screening tests (where test performance is usually measured on a continuous scale from low to high), substantial overlap is to be expected between players with high and low risk of injury. Therefore, although there are a number of tests demonstrating a statistically significant association with injury risk, and therefore help the understanding of causative factors, such tests are unlikely to be able to predict injury with sufficient accuracy. The final step needed is to document that an intervention programme targeting athletes identified as being at high risk through a screening programme is more beneficial than the same intervention programme given to all athletes (step 3). To date, there is no intervention study providing support for screening for injury risk.},

abstract = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95{\%} confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

Results indicated that approximate metric and scalar invariance was established. From a methodological standpoint, this study demonstrated the usefulness and flexibility of Bayesian estimation for single-sample and multigroup analyses of measurement instruments. Substantively, the current findings suggest that the measurement of mental toughness requires cultural adjustments to better capture the contextually salient (emic) aspects of this concept.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Allostatic load is a multiple biomarker measure of physiological ‘wear and tear' that has shown some promise as marker of overall physiological health, but its power as a risk predictor for mortality and morbidity is less well known. This study has used data from the 2003 Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) (nationally representative sample of Scottish population) linked to mortality records to assess how well allostatic load predicts all-cause and cause-specific mortality. From the sample, data from 4,488 men and women were available with mortality status at 5 and 9.5 (rounded to 10) years after sampling in 2003. Cox proportional hazard models estimated t he risk of death (all-cause and the five major causes of death in the population) according to allostatic load score. Multiple imputation was used to address missing values in the dataset. Analyses were also adjusted for potential confounders (sex, age and deprivation). There were 258 and 618 deaths over the 5-year and 10-year follow-up period, respectively. In the fully-adjusted model, higher allostatic load (poorer physiological ‘health') was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after 5 years (HR = 1.07, 95{\%} CI 0.94 to 1.22; p = 0.269), but it was after 10 years (HR = 1.08, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.16; p = 0.026). Allostatic load was not associated with specific causes of death over the same follow-up period. In conclusions, greater physiological wear and tear across multiple physiological systems, as measured by allostatic load, is associated with an increased risk of death, but may not be as useful as a predictor for specific causes of death.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Numerous studies have documented the incidence and nature of injuries in professional rugby union, but few have identified specific risk factors for injury in this population using appropriate statistical methods. In particular, little is known about the role of previous short-term or longer-term match exposures in current injury risk in this setting. OBJECTIVES Our objective was to investigate the influence that match exposure has upon injury risk in rugby union. METHOD We conducted a seven-season (2006/7-2012/13) prospective cohort study of time-loss injuries in 1253 English premiership professional players. Players' 12-month match exposure (number of matches a player was involved in for ≥20 min in the preceding 12 months) and 1-month match exposure (number of full-game equivalent [FGE] matches in preceding 30 days) were assessed as risk factors for injury using a nested frailty model and magnitude-based inferences. RESULTS The 12-month match exposure was associated with injury risk in a non-linear fashion; players who had been involved in fewer than ≈15 or more than ≈35 matches over the preceding 12-month period were more susceptible to injury. Monthly match exposure was linearly associated with injury risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14 per 2 standard deviation [3.2 FGE] increase, 90{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.20; likely harmful), although this effect was substantially attenuated for players in the upper quartile for 12-month match exposures ({\textgreater}28 matches). CONCLUSION A player's accumulated (12-month) and recent (1-month) match exposure substantially influences their current injury risk. Careful attention should be paid to planning the workloads and monitoring the responses of players involved in: (1) a high ({\textgreater}≈35) number of matches in the previous year, (2) a low ({\textless}≈15) number of matches in the previous year, and (3) a low-moderate number of matches in previous year but who have played intensively in the recent past. These findings make a major contribution to evidence-based policy decisions regarding match workload limits in professional rugby union.},

abstract = {Vagal activity – reflecting the activation of stress regulatory mechanisms and prefrontal cortex activation – is thought to play an inhibitory role in the regulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis. However, most studies investigating the association between stress-induced changes in heart rate variability (HRV, an index of cardiac vagal tone) and cortisol have shown a non-significant relationship. It has been proposed that physiological changes observed during anticipation of a stressor allow individuals to make behavioral, cognitive, and physiological adjustments that are necessary to deal with the upcoming actual stressor. In this study, in a large sample of 171 healthy adults (96 men and 75 women; mean age = 29.98, SD = 11.07), we investigated whether the cortisol response to a laboratory-based stress task was related to anticipation-induced or stress task-induced changes in HRV. As expected, regression analyses showed that a larger decrease in HRV during the anticipation of a stress task was related to higher stress task-induced cortisol increase, but not cortisol recovery. In line with prior research, the stress task-induced change in HRV was not significantly related to cortisol increase or recovery. Our results show for the first time that anticipatory HRV (reflecting differences in stress regulation and prefrontal activity before the encounter with the stressor) is important to understand the stress-induced cortisol increase.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s). Background: Physical activity plays an important role in public health, owing to a range of health-related benefits that it provides. Sports-related injuries are known to be an important barrier to continued physical activity. Still, the prevalence of injuries on a general population level has not yet been explored in a descriptive epidemiological investigation. The purpose of the questionnaire-based study, therefore, was to describe the prevalence of injury in a representative sample of the Danish population. Methods: Two samples of 10,000 adults ({\textgreater} 15 years) and 6500 children and adolescents (7–15 years) were invited to respond to a web-based questionnaire. Of these, 3498 adults (35.0{\%}) and 3221 children (49.6{\%}) responded successfully. The definition of sports injury was time-loss and medical attention-based, inhibiting participants from sports activity for at least 7 days, and/or involved contact with a healthcare professional, respectively. Results: Amongst adults, 642 (18.4{\%} [95{\%}CI: 17.1{\%}; 19.6{\%}]) reported to have had an injury within the past 12 months. Males reported significantly more injuries than females (difference in prevalence proportion: 9.2{\%}-points [95{\%}CI: 6.7{\%}-points; 11.8{\%}-points]). The prevalence of injuries was greatest in running (ninj = 198), football (ninj = 94) and strength training (ninj = 89). Amongst children, 621 (19.3{\%} [95{\%}CI: 17.9{\%}; 20.6{\%}]) had been injured. No difference in injury prevalence proportion existed between boys and girls. The prevalence of injuries was greatest in football (ninj = 235), handball (ninj = 86) and gymnastics (ninj = 66). Conclusions: Sports injuries seem to be very frequent in Denmark, since a total of 18.4{\%} of the adults and 19.3{\%} of the children reported having had one or more injuries within the past 12 months, equal to either time lost with physical activity and/or contact to the health care system.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the cardiorespiratory (CR) and stress hormone responses to a combined physical and mental stress. Eight participants (VO2(max) = 41.24 +/- 6.20 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) completed two experimental conditions, a treatment condition including a 37 min ride at 60{\%} of VO2(max) with participants responding to a computerized mental challenge dual stress condition (DSC) and a control condition of the same duration and intensity without the mental challenge exercise alone condition (EAC). Significant interactions across time were found for CR responses, with heart rate, ventilation, and respiration rate demonstrating higher increases in the DSC. Additionally, norepinephrine was significantly greater in the DSC at the end of the combined challenge. Furthermore, cortisol area-under-the-curve (AUC) was also significantly elevated during the DSC. These results demonstrate that a mental challenge during exercise can exacerbate the stress response, including the release of hormones that have been linked to negative health consequences (cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune illnesses).},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Sensorimotor control is impaired after ankle injury and in fatigued conditions. However, little is known about fatigue-induced alterations of postural control in athletes who have experienced an ankle sprain in the past.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of fatiguing exercise on static and dynamic balance abilities in athletes who have successfully returned to preinjury levels of sport activity after an ankle sprain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Cohort study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: University sport science research laboratory.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: 30 active athletes, 14 with a previous severe ankle sprain (return to sport activity 6-36 months before study entry; no residual symptoms or subjective instability) and 16 uninjured controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTION(S): Fatiguing treadmill running in 2 experimental sessions to assess dependent measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Center-of-pressure sway velocity in single-legged stance and time to stabilization (TTS) after a unilateral jump-landing task (session 1) and maximum reach distance in the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) (session 2) were assessed before and immediately after a fatiguing treadmill exercise. A 2-factorial linear mixed model was specified for each of the main outcomes, and effect sizes (ESs) were calculated as Cohen d.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the unfatigued condition, between-groups differences existed only for the anterior-posterior TTS (P = .05, ES = 0.39). Group-by-fatigue interactions were found for mean SEBT (P = .03, ES = 0.43) and anterior-posterior TTS (P = .02, ES = 0.48). Prefatigue versus postfatigue SEBT and TTS differences were greater in previously injured athletes, whereas static sway velocity increased similarly in both groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Fatiguing running significantly affected static and dynamic postural control in participants with a history of ankle sprain. Fatigue-induced alterations of dynamic postural control were greater in athletes with a previous ankle sprain. Thus, even after successful return to competition, ongoing deficits in sensorimotor control may contribute to the enhanced ankle reinjury risk.},

Competitive runners were monitored in a prospective non-experimental cohort study over one full training season in which they experienced the same unplanned severe NLE. 16 runners recorded stress and recovery scores (RESTQ-Sport) every week. The average scores over 3 weeks before the NLE were used as a baseline and were compared to scores during the week of the NLE (week 0), week 1 and week 2. 7 runners completed a submaximal treadmill test before and after the NLE. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that most scores on general stress scales were increased in week 0 and 1. Of the general recovery scales, "general well-being" was decreased in week 0 and 1, "social" and "physical recovery" were decreased in week 0. No changes in the sport-specific stress scales were found. However, 2 of the sport-specific recovery scales were decreased in week 0. An impaired RE was shown 3 weeks after the NLE. Therefore, it is important to know what is going on in an athlete's life, because stressful life events alter RE after the stress and recovery already returned to normal levels.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a Bayesian formulation of the so-called magnitude-based inference approach to quantifying and interpreting effects, and in a case study example provide accurate probabilistic statements that correspond to the intended magnitude-based inferences. The model is described in the context of a published small-scale athlete study which employed a magnitude-based inference approach to compare the effect of two altitude training regimens (live high-train low (LHTL), and intermittent hypoxic exposure (IHE)) on running performance and blood measurements of elite triathletes. The posterior distributions, and corresponding point and interval estimates, for the parameters and associated effects and comparisons of interest, were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The Bayesian analysis was shown to provide more direct probabilistic comparisons of treatments and able to identify small effects of interest. The approach avoided asymptotic assumptions and overcame issues such as multiple testing. Bayesian analysis of unscaled effects showed a probability of 0.96 that LHTL yields a substantially greater increase in hemoglobin mass than IHE, a 0.93 probability of a substantially greater improvement in running economy and a greater than 0.96 probability that both IHE and LHTL yield a substantially greater improvement in maximum blood lactate concentration compared to a Placebo. The conclusions are consistent with those obtained using a 'magnitude-based inference' approach that has been promoted in the field. The paper demonstrates that a fully Bayesian analysis is a simple and effective way of analysing small effects, providing a rich set of results that are straightforward to interpret in terms of probabilistic statements.},

abstract = {Human research has shown the administration of cortisol into the circulation at rest will result in reduced blood testosterone levels. Many researchers have used these results to imply that physical exercise induced cortisol increases would perhaps result in subsequent reductions in circulating testosterone levels. Our purpose was to examine this concept and determine what, if any, relationship exists between circulating cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) in men (n = 45, 26.3 3.8 yr) at rest and after exercise. Blood samples were collect at rest (10 hour post-prandial; denoted as 'Resting'; n = 45) and again on the same day at 1.0 hr into recovery from intensive exercise (denoted as 'Exercise Recovery'; n = 45). Approximately 48-96 hr after this initial (Trial {\#} 1) blood collection protocol the subjects replicated the exact procedures again and provided a second Resting and Exercise Recovery set of blood samples (Trial {\#} 2). Blood samples from Trial {\#} 1and Trial {\#} 2 were pooled (Resting, n = 90; Exercise Recovery, n = 90). The blood samples were analyzed by radioimmunoassay for C, total T (TT), and free T (fT). Pearson correlation coefficients for the Resting samples ([TT vs. C] r {\textless} +0.01; [fT vs. C] r = +0.06) were not significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05). For the Exercise Recovery samples ([TT vs. C] r = -0.53; [fT vs. C] r = +0.21) correlation coefficients were significant (p {\textless} 0.05). The findings indicate that exercise does allow the development of a significant negative relationship between C and TT. Interestingly, a significant positive relationship developed between C and fT following exercise; possibly due to an adrenal cortex contribution of fT or disassociation of fT from sex hormone binding globulin. The detected in vivo relationships between C and T, however, were associative and not causal in nature and were small to moderate at best in strength. Key PointsPharmacologically increased levels of cortisol have a significant negative effect on circulating testosteroneAfter certain types of physical exercise a negative statistical associative relationship exist between cortisol and total testosterone.},

abstract = {Previous studies of hormonal and neurophysiological changes in response to psychological stress in humans have produced contrasting findings due to differing experimental procedures and consistent individual variability. Habituation effects, which influence physiological coping in response to exposure to repeated stress, need to be investigated more extensively. In the present study, twenty healthy male subjects were each exposed twice to the same psychosocial stressor (Stroop Color Word Interference task, public speaking and mental arithmetic in front of an audience) during a first session (day 1) and a second session (day 8). Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT) and prolactin (PRL) were measured immediately before the beginning of the tests and at their end, 30 min later, on both experimental days. For the total group, NE, EPI, ACTH, and CORT levels were significantly elevated, and PRL levels were significantly decreased, after stress exposure on day 1. ACTH and CORT levels showed less significant increases after stress on day 8. In contrast, NE and EPI responses to stress were not significantly blunted, and PRL response was unchanged on day 8. Cluster analysis revealed two groups of subjects who showed different habituation patterns for ACTH and CORT. The first group (n = 12) of subjects showed a reduction of ACTH and CORT responses to stress on day 8. The subjects of the second group (n = 8) displayed a significant increase of ACTH and cortisol in response to stress on day 8, without any habituation effect. These results increase the evidence concerning the involvement of the HPA axis and catecholamines in response to psychological stress, and suggest that possible individual differences in the neuroendocrine coping mechanisms may affect mood regulation and the state of health.

The sample reported 321 injuries, a rate of 1.98 injuries per gymnast (2.36 for the elite gymnasts and 1.83 for the non-elite gymnasts). It was found that for the overall sample and for the non-elite gymnasts, life stress was a significant predictor of injury. For the elite gymnasts, a more internal locus of control significantly predicted injury. The findings indicate the importance of the sports physiotherapist's awareness of the role of stress both as a predisposing factor to injury and also as a variable that should be considered during the rehabilitation process.},

abstract = {Objectives In order to investigate the applicability of routine 10s electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings for time-domain heart rate variability (HRV) calculation we explored to what extent these (ultra-)short recordings capture the “actual” HRV.   Methods The standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) were measured in 3,387 adults. SDNN and RMSSD were assessed from (ultra)short recordings of 10s(3x), 30s, and 120s and compared to 240s–300s (gold standard) measurements. Pearson's correlation coefficients (r), Bland-Altman 95{\%} limits of agreement and Cohen's d statistics were used as agreement analysis techniques.   Results Agreement between the separate 10s recordings and the 240s-300s recording was already substantial (r = 0.758–0.764/Bias = 0.398–0.416/d = 0.855–0.894 for SDNN; r = 0.853–0.862/Bias = 0.079–0.096/d = 0.150–0.171 for RMSSD), and improved further when three 10s periods were averaged (r = 0.863/Bias = 0.406/d = 0.874 for SDNN; r = 0.941/Bias = 0.088/d = 0.167 for RMSSD). Agreement increased with recording length and reached near perfect agreement at 120s (r = 0.956/Bias = 0.064/d = 0.137 for SDNN; r = 0.986/Bias = 0.014/d = 0.027 for RMSSD). For all recording lengths and agreement measures, RMSSD outperformed SDNN.   Conclusions Our results confirm that it is unnecessary to use recordings longer than 120s to obtain accurate measures of RMSSD and SDNN in the time domain. Even a single 10s (standard ECG) recording yields a valid RMSSD measurement, although an average over multiple 10s ECGs is preferable. For SDNN we would recommend either 30s or multiple 10s ECGs. Future research projects using time-domain HRV parameters, e.g. genetic epidemiological studies, could calculate HRV from (ultra-)short ECGs enabling such projects to be performed at a large scale.},

In order to validate different algorithms developed for detecting OSA employing HRV analysis, several public or proprietary data collections have been employed for different research groups. However, for validation purposes, it is obvious and evident the lack of a common standard database, worldwide recognized and accepted by the scientific community. In this paper, different algorithms employing HRV analysis were applied over diverse public and proprietary databases for detecting OSA, and the outcomes were validated in terms of a statistical analysis. Results indicate that the use of a specific database may strongly affect the performance of the algorithms, due to differences in methodologies of processing. Our results suggest that researchers must strongly take into consideration the database used when quoting their results, since selected cases are highly database dependent and would bias conclusions.},

abstract = {Transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke have high risks of recurrence and deterioration into severe ischemic strokes. Risk stratification of TIA and minor stroke is essential for early effective treatment. Traditional tools have only moderate predictive value, likely due to their inclusion of the limited number of stroke risk factors. Our review follows Hans Selye's fundamental work on stress theory and the progressive shift of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) from adaptation to disease when stress becomes chronic. We will first show that traditional risk factors and acute triggers of ischemic stroke are chronic and acute stress factors or "stressors," respectively. Our first review shows solid evidence of the relationship between chronic stress and stroke occurrence. The stress response is tightly regulated by the ANS whose function can be assessed with heart rate variability (HRV). Our second review demonstrates that stress-related risk factors of ischemic stroke are correlated with ANS dysfunction and impaired HRV. Our conclusions support the idea that HRV parameters may represent the combined effects of all body stressors that are risk factors for ischemic stroke and, thus, may be of important predictive value for the risk of subsequent ischemic events after TIA or minor stroke.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Monitoring training from a multifactorial point of view is of great importance in elite endurance athletes. This study aims to analyze the relationships between indicators of training load, hormonal status and neuromuscular performance, and to compare these values with competition performance, in elite middle and long-distance runners. METHOD Fifteen elite middle and long-distance runners (12 men, 3 women; age = 26.3±5.1 yrs) were measured for training volume, training zone and session rate of perceived exertion (RPE) (daily), countermovement jump (CMJ) and salivary free cortisol (weekly) for 39 weeks (i.e., the whole season). Competition performance was also observed throughout the study, registering the season best and worst competitions. RESULTS Season average salivary free cortisol concentrations correlate significantly with CMJ (r = -0.777) and RPE (r = 0.551). Also, weekly averages of CMJ significantly correlates with RPE (r = -0.426), distance run (r = -0.593, p{\textless}0.001) and training zone (r = 0.437, p{\textless}0.05). Finally, it was found that the CMJ (+8.5{\%}, g = 0.65) and the RPE (-17.6{\%}, g = 0.94) measured the week before the best competition performance of the season were significantly different compared with the measurement conducted the week before the season's worst competition performance. CONCLUSIONS Monitoring weekly measurements of CMJ and RPE could be recommended to control training process of such athletes in a non-invasive, field-based, systematic way.},

abstract = {Background Sports injury and illness surveillance is the first step in injury and illness prevention, and is important for the protection of both athlete health and performance in major competitions. Aim To identify the prevalence, severity nature and causes of athlete injuries and illnesses in the Great Britain Olympic Team (TeamGB) during the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games. Methods The observational prospective cohort study followed the Great Britain Injury/Illness Performance Project surveillance methodology and obtained information on injuries and illnesses that occurred during the Games between 30 January and 23 February 2014 in TeamGB athletes (n=56). Results Among the 56 TeamGB athletes, there were 27 injuries and 11 illnesses during the Olympic Games period. This equated to 39{\%} sustaining at least one injury and 18{\%} at least one illness, with an incidence of 48.2 injuries and 19.6 illnesses per 100 athletes, respectively. Of all injuries and illnesses, 9{\%} and 7{\%}, respectively, resulted in time loss. The risk of sustaining an injury was highest for freestyle skiing, skeleton and snowboarding; and lowest for curling, biathlon and Alpine skiing (with no reported injuries); with the lower limb being the most commonly injured location. Respiratory system illnesses were most frequently reported overall, and older female athletes were the ones most affected by illness. Conclusions The risk of injury was double the risk of illness for TeamGB athletes. Overall, the rate of time-loss issues was low. Methodological considerations are important when interpreting data, and prevention strategies should focus on those issues causing the greatest risk, in terms of prevalence and severity, to athlete health and performance.

YBT has been proposed as a screen for injury risk however limited research has examined the association between YBT and injury. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between YBT (asymmetry and composite score [CS]) and non-contact injury in a sample of Division I (DI) college athletes from multiple sports.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: DI college athletes were screened with the YBT during the pre-participation examination to determine asymmetry (absolute difference between legs in ANT, PL, and PM) and CS (summed average of right/left ANT, PL, and PM normalized to leg length). Participants were followed throughout the sport season and non-contact injuries requiring athletic training staff intervention were recorded for analysis. Demographic variables between injured and not injured were assessed with independent t-tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined optimal cut-points for predicting injury based on CS and asymmetry. CS was analyzed as a continuous variable as ROC curves were unable to maximize sensitivity and specificity. Logistic regression models adjusted for sport and previous injury determined the odds of injury based on asymmetry and CS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 184 participants were included in analysis: 81 were injured. ROC curves determined asymmetry {\textgreater} 4 cm (Sensitivity=59{\%}; Specificity=72{\%}) as the optimal cut-point for predicting injury. Only ANT asymmetry was significantly associated with non-contact injury (odds ratio=2.33, 95{\%} confidence interval [1.15-4.76]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: ANT asymmetry {\textgreater} 4 cm was associated with increased risk of non-contact injury.

Walter Lippmann (1914) Psychology has always been plagued by passing fads and fan cies to a greater extent than is seemly in a scientific discipline.

Indeed, a recent poll of academic psychologists in American indicated that over 80{\%} of them regarded themselves as cognitive psychologists! Cognitive psychology is in the ascendant, but it has never been clear to me that it has addressed all of the appropriate is sues. In particular, information processing in the real world (and even in the laboratory) occurs within a motivational and emotional context, but cognitive psychologists usually main tain the convenient fiction that cognition can fruitfully be stud ied in isolation. The main reason for writing this book was to at tempt to demonstrate that there can be a useful cross-fertiliza tion between cognitive and motivational-emotional psycholo gy and that there are already tantalizing glimpses of the poten tial advantages of such inter-disciplinary research. The ideas of Donald Broadbent and his associates have exer cised a formative influence during the writing of this book.

abstract = {There is a need for an integrated perspective on sports injury

Science and medical researchers and practitioners working in the field of sports injury prevention tend to have very tangible objectives and focus on identifying and solving specific injury risks. There is an uncertainty, however, that “solving” one problem may not simply create another. As the field matures, it is worth considering whether theories and models can be developed that have more general application to a range of injury issues. There is a need for an integrated perspective on sports injury that is inclusive of medical, behavioural (psychological, sociological, and organisational), physiological, and biomechanical factors. On the one hand, training and skills development are advocated as the best methods to reduce injury, but injury rates appear only to increase the more competitively a person approaches sport. This leads to the questions: are significant reductions in sports injury risk possible at all—or in only very specific sports, age groups, or competition levels—and only through absolute reductions in exposure, or after reconsideration of injury prevention methods?

A biomechanically focused model of injury causation and prevention has been developed that draws on models by Wismans1 and Norton.2 From a biomechanical perspective, injury is “equivalent to the failure of a machine or structure”.3 Injury results from a transfer of energy to the tissue. The mechanical properties of human tissue, such as stiffness (stress–strain relation), ultimate strength, and critical stress, govern how the body responds to physical loads. {\ldots}},

abstract = {The psychological factors of sports injuries constitute a growing field of study, even from the point of view of the prediction of their occurrence. Most of them, however, do not take into account the likelihood of the injuries' occurrence and the weight and role of the psychological variables on it. We conducted a study building up a Bayesian Network on a big sample of athletes, trying to assess these probabilistic links among several relevant psychological variables and the injuries' occurrence. The sample was constituted by 297 athletes (239 males, 58 females) from a wide range of sports: track and field; judo; fencing; karate; boxing; swimming; kayaking; artistic rollerskating, and team sports as football, basketball, and handball (Mean age: 25.10 +/--3.87; range: 21-38 years). Severalr psychological variables, such as anxiety, social support, and self-efficacy were studied. Also, we recorded the history of injuries as well the body mass index and personal epidemiological data. The overall picture of the generated graph and Bayesian Network and its analysis - including the use of hypothetical data by means of several instantiations - includes the nuclear role of the Self-Efficacy regarding the injuries' occurrence likelihood; the decreasing impact of the competitive anxiety previous to the injury; the probabilistic independence of the players' risk behaviors, and the relevance of the environmental clues such the use of coping strategies and social support in order to build up a good level of Self-Efficacy after the occurrence of an injury. All these data are relevant when designing both preventive and recovery interventions from the multidisciplinary as well as from the psychological point of view.},

The paper includes optimization of team's performance and collective efficacy using intercausal reasoning pattern which constitutes a very common pattern in human reasoning. The BN is used to make inferences regarding our problem, and therefore we obtain some conclusions; among them: maximizing the team's performance causes a decrease in collective efficacy and when team's performance achieves the minimum value it causes an increase in moderate/high values of collective efficacy. Similarly, we may reason optimizing team collective efficacy instead. It also allows us to determine the features that have the strongest influence on performance and which on collective efficacy. From the BN two different coaching styles were differentiated taking into account the local Markov property: training leadership and autocratic leadership.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Numerous empirical studies suggest that specific psychological factors influence the frequency and severity of sport injuries. The main purpose of the present study is to outline the psychological factors, which predict increased injury vulnerability among professional male soccer players in Denmark. Based on the Stress-Injury Model by Williams {\&} Anderson (1998) it is hypothesized that low coping resources, high competitive trait anxiety, and history of previous injuries would be positively related to an increased risk of injury occurrence and severity. METHODS: The soccer players (N = 87) were asked to report history of previous injuries within the last 12 months. Furthermore, 2 questionnaires were used; Competitive Trait Anxiety Test, and Athletic Coping Skills Inventory - 28 (ACSI-28). Injuries were prospectively recorded throughout a period of approximately 3 months by the team's medical staff (doctors and physiotherapists). RESULTS: Study findings clearly suggest that history of previous injury and coping with adversity are the best predictors of injury occurrence. These factors explained between 7 {\%} and 11 {\%} of the total variance of injury occurrence and days lost due to injury respectively. Furthermore, the same variables were found very successful in prediction injury occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the suggestions that psychological factors can be utilized as a predictive measurement to sport injuries, which should be considered by coaches and medical staff in order to reduce vulnerability to injury.},

abstract = {Stress begins in the brain and affects the brain, as well as the rest of the body. Acute stress responses promote adaptation and survival via responses of neural, cardiovascular, autonomic, immune and metabolic systems. Chronic stress can promote and exacerbate pathophysiology through the same systems that are dysregulated. The burden of chronic stress and accompanying changes in personal behaviors (smoking, eating too much, drinking, poor quality sleep; otherwise referred to as "lifestyle") is called allostatic overload. Brain regions such as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and amygdala respond to acute and chronic stress and show changes in morphology and chemistry that are largely reversible if the chronic stress lasts for weeks. However, it is not clear whether prolonged stress for many months or years may have irreversible effects on the brain. The adaptive plasticity of chronic stress involves many mediators, including glucocorticoids, excitatory amino acids, endogenous factors such as brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The role of this stress-induced remodeling of neural circuitry is discussed in relation to psychiatric illnesses, as well as chronic stress and the concept of top-down regulation of cognitive, autonomic and neuroendocrine function. This concept leads to a different way of regarding more holistic manipulations, such as physical activity and social support as an important complement to pharmaceutical therapy in treatment of the common phenomenon of being "stressed out". Policies of government and the private sector play an important role in this top-down view of minimizing the burden of chronic stress and related lifestyle (i.e. allostatic overload). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Large effect sizes (ES) suggested that elite players also possessed higher K(vert) than sub-elite (d = 1.11) and representative (d = 1.11) players. A number of large and moderate ES were also present when comparing the passive stiffness of elite players to their lower-ranked counterparts. The results of this study suggest that elite players possess higher levels of active stiffness when compared with their lower-ranked counterparts. The differences in stiffness levels may contribute to a player's ability to physically perform at an elite level and also provide one explanation into elevated rates of injury at higher levels of competition.},

abstract = {Past research has identified a positive relationship between life-event stress and football injuries, but research in other sports has yielded more ambiguous results. It seems, then, that the relation of life stress and injury may be sport-specific and that different sports must be studied separately before such a relationship is assumed. The present investigation examined the relationships among life-event stress, coping skills, social support, and injuries of male and female high school basketball players. Contrary to the hypothesis, the number of days missed due to injury was not significantly related to life-event stress. As expected, the injury measure was negatively correlated with both the coping-skills and social-support variables, but these correlations did not reach statistical significance. Recommendations for research are discussed.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effects of fixed foot and functionally directed balance training on static balance time, muscle activation during landing, vertical jump height and sprint time. Twenty-four recreationally active females were tested pre- and post-training (fixed foot balance training, n= 11, functionally directed balance training, n = 7 and control group, n = 6). Experimental subjects completed either fixed foot or functionally directed balance exercises 4 times/week for 6 weeks. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to assess preparatory and reactive muscle activity of the rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), and the soleus during one- and two-foot landings following a jump. Maximum vertical jump height, static balance and 20-meter sprint times were also examined. The fixed foot balance-training group showed a 33{\%} improvement (p {\textless} 0.05) in static balance time and 9{\%} improvement in jump height. Neither type of training improved sprint times. Further analysis revealed significant (p {\textless} 0.05) overall (data collapsed over groups and legs) increases in reactive RF activity when landing. Independently, the fixed foot balance group showed a 33{\%} increase in reactive RF activity (p {\textless} 0.01). Overall, there was also significantly less reactive co-activation following training (p {\textless} 0.05). It appears that fixed foot balance training for recreationally active women may provide greater RF activity when landing and increased countermovement jump height. Key pointsBalance training increased rectus femoris EMG activity upon landing from a stride.Fixed foot balance training improved countermovement jump height.Neither fixed foot nor functionally directed balance training elicited changes in sprint times.},

Study 2 investigated the reliability of subsequent modifications of the BESS. Design: Prospective cross-sectional examination of the traditional and modified BESS protocols. Setting: Schools participating in Georgia High School Athletics Association. Intervention: The modified BESS consisted of 2 surfaces (firm and foam) and 2 stances (single-leg and tandem-leg stance) repeated for a total of three 20-second trials. Participants: Participants consisted of 2 independent samples of high school athletes aged 13 to 19 years. Main Outcome Measures: Percent variance for each condition of the BESS was obtained using GENOVA 3.1. An intraclass reliability coefficient and repeated measures analysis of variance were calcu-lated using SPSS 13.0. Results: Study 1 obtained an intraclass correlation coefficient (r = 0.60) with stance accounting for 55{\%} of the total variance. Removing the double-leg stance increased the intraclass correlation coefficient (r = 0.71). Study 2 found a statistically significant difference between trials 1 and 2 (F(1.65,286) = 4.890, P = 0.013) and intraclass re-liability coefficient of r = 0.88 for 3 trials of 4 conditions. Conclusions: The variance associated with the double-leg stance was very small, and when removed, the intraclass reliability co-efficient of the BESS increased. Removal of the double-leg stance and addition of 3 trials of 4 conditions provided an easily administered, cost-effective, time-efficient tool that provides reliable objective in-formation for clinicians to base clinical decisions upon.},

abstract = {Background: Age and gender effects on muscle tone and mechanical properties have not been studied using hand-held myometric technology. Monitoring changes in muscle properties with ageing in community settings may provide a valuable assessment tool for detecting those at risk of premature decline and sarcopenia. Objective: This study aimed to provide objective data on the effects of ageing and gender on muscle tone and mechanical properties of quadriceps (rectus femoris) and biceps brachii muscles. Methods: In a comparative study of 123 healthy males and females (aged 18-90 years; n=. 61 aged 18-35; n=. 62 aged 65-90) muscle tone, elasticity and stiffness were measured using the MyotonPRO device. Results: Stiffness was greater and elasticity lower in older adults for BB and RF (. p{\textless}. 0.001). Tone was significantly greater in older adults for BB but not for RF when data for males and females were combined (. p=. 0.28). There were no gender differences for BB in either age group. In RF, males had greater stiffness (young males 292 vs females 233. N/m; older males 328 vs females 311. N/m) and tone (young 16.4 vs 13.6. Hz; older 16.7 vs 14.9. Hz). Elasticity in RF was lower in young males than females but did not differ between the older groups (both males and females log decrement 1.6). Conclusions: Stiffness and tone increased with ageing and elasticity decreased. These findings have implications for detecting frailty using a novel biomarker. Age and gender differences are important to consider when assessing effects of pathological conditions on muscle properties in older people.},

They differ in their conceptualizations and operational constructs, and this poses a problem for their differential validity and the generalizability of results, and comparison of results from different studies. This paper examined the psychometric properties of five of these RST questionnaires, with a total sample of 821 participants, taken from the factor structures for the Croatian translations of BIS/BAS scales, SPSRQ, Jackson-5, RSQ and RST-PQ. Data were analysed by correlational and confirmatory factor analyses. We found some of these questionnaires achieved marginal to adequate fit indices, and they showed ambiguity in terms of convergent validity for all three general behavioural systems. These findings highlight the difficulties with generalization and comparison of results with the use of different RST questionnaires. Based on these findings, as well as the ongoing debate concerning how best to measure RST constructs, we provide information on how to interpret results from the studies conducted with different RST scales.},

abstract = {Stabilometry is an objective method used for studying postural equilibrium quantitatively. Stabilometric recordings were made in 127 soccer players to demonstrate functional instability of the ankle joint. The presence of previous ankle joint injuries, i.e., sprains or fractures, was documented. Reference values for stabilometry were obtained from a group of 30 normally-active non-soccer players without a history of injury to the ankle joint. A pathological stabilometric value was defined as one exceeding the mean value of the reference group by 2 SD. In players with a history of previous ankle joint injury no increased postural sway was found. On the other hand, players showing abnormal stabilometric values ran a significantly (P less than 0.001) higher risk of sustaining an ankle injury during the following season compared to players with normal values. Players with a history of previous ankle joint injury did not run a higher risk compared to players without previous injury. The findings indicate that an ankle joint injury did not result in a persistent functional instability; however, such instability did increase the risk of ankle joint injury.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hundreds of scientific publications are produced annually that involve the measurement of cortisol in saliva. Intra- and inter-laboratory variation in salivary cortisol results has the potential to contribute to cross-study inconsistencies in findings, and the perception that salivary cortisol results are unreliable. This study rigorously estimates sources of measurement variability in the assay of salivary cortisol within and between established international academic-based laboratories that specialize in saliva analyses. One hundred young adults (Mean age: 23.10 years; 62 females) donated 2 mL of whole saliva by passive drool. Each sample was split into multiple- 100 microL aliquots and immediately frozen. One aliquot of each of the 100 participants' saliva was transported to academic laboratories (N = 9) in the United States, Canada, UK, and Germany and assayed for cortisol by the same commercially available immunoassay. RESULTS: 1.76{\%} of the variance in salivary cortisol levels was attributable to differences between duplicate assays of the same sample within laboratories, 7.93{\%} of the variance was associated with differences between laboratories, and 90.31{\%} to differences between samples. In established-qualified laboratories, measurement error of salivary cortisol is minimal, and inter-laboratory differences in measurement are unlikely to have a major influence on the determined values.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether repeated administration of the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) and Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) demonstrates a practice effect in high school athletes. DESIGN AND SETTING: Subjects were assigned to either a control or practice group. Subjects in the control group were assessed twice, 30 days apart. Subjects in the practice group were assessed on 5 occasions. Four assessments were performed within a 7-day period and 1 more assessment 30 days after the initial test. SUBJECTS: Thirty-two uninjured high school athletes participated in this investigation. Sixteen were randomly assigned to a control group and 16 to a practice group. MEASUREMENTS: We measured performance on the SAC and on 6 test conditions of the BESS. RESULTS: We found a significant time-by-group interaction on BESS performance on the day-30 test session. A significant practice effect of the BESS was found during the course of repeated administrations in the practice group. After repeated testing, the number of BESS errors decreased with each test session, and error scores on day 5 (10.94 +/- 2.17) and day 7 (9.44 +/- 3.32) were significantly lower than the baseline score (12.88 +/- 3.34). We did not find group differences or a practice effect on the SAC (baseline score = 26.16). CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed no practice effect with the SAC and a slight practice effect with repeated administrations of the BESS, especially with the single-leg stance on foam. Clinicians must acknowledge the potential for practice effects when readministering these concussion assessments to track recovery of an athlete or as a guide in return-to-play decision making.},

abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) are increasingly being used to model complex coastal processes due to their ability to integrate non-linear systems, their transparent probabilistic framework, and low computational cost. A BN may be suited to descriptive or predictive application. Descriptive BNs are highly calibrated models that are useful for better understanding the physics and causal relationships driving a system. Predictive BNs are generalisations of a system that have skill at predicting outside of the training domain. The predictive and descriptive usefulness of a BN depends on its complexity and the amount of data available to train it, but there is often a trade-off; higher descriptive skill comes at the cost of reduced predictive skill. To demonstrate the differences between predictive and descriptive BNs in a coastal engineering context, a BN to predict shoreline recession caused by coastal storm events is developed and tested using an extensive 10-year dataset incorporating 137 individual storms events monitored at Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach, Australia. A parsimonious approach to BN development is used to separately determine the optimum predictive and descriptive BNs for this dataset. Results show that for this dataset two quite different BNs can be developed: one that is optimized to achieve the highest predictive skill, and a second network that is optimized to maximize descriptive skill. The optimum predictive BN is found to comprise 3 nodes (variables) and can predict the shoreline recession caused by unseen storm events with a skill of 65{\%}. The optimum descriptive BN is composed of 5 nodes and can reproduce 88{\%} of the training dataset, but with more limited predictive capabilities. The uses and limitations of these two different approaches to BN formulation are illustrated with example applications to coastal process modelling. It is anticipated that the insights provided in this paper will help to clarify the further development of Bayesian Networks applied to coastal modelling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Active adults commonly present with lower extremity (LE) injuries from a variety of professional and amateur sports activities. Decreased LE function significantly alters daily life and subsequent injuries increase this impact. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the association between previous injury and the risk of re-injury, and to describe the changes in kinematics and motor programming that may contribute to this relationship. METHODS A preliminary search was conducted to determine the four most common LE injuries on PubMed, CINAHL and Web of Science. These injuries, in a healthy active adult population, were hamstring strain (HS), anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL), achilles tendon pathology, and ankle sprain. After these injuries were established, the search for this systematic review found evidence relating these injuries to re-injury. Articles related to degenerative changes were excluded. Twenty-six articles were included in the systematic review detailing the risk of re-injury from a previous injury and were graded for quality. RESULTS ACL injury was linked to a successive injury of the same ACL, and other injuries in the LE. HS was associated with subsequent ipsilateral HS and knee injuries. Previous achilles tendon rupture increased the risk of an analogous injury on the contralateral side. An ankle sprain was associated with a re-injury of either the ipsilateral or the contralateral ankle. Post-injury changes were present in strength, proprioception, and kinematics, which may have led to overall changes in motor control and function. CONCLUSION This review provides insight into the changes occurring following common LE injuries, how these changes potentially affect risk for future injury, and address the needs of the active adult population in rehabilitation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Current research on previous injury and re-injury is of high quality, but scarce quantity. Deficits following an injury are known, but how these deficits correlate or lead to re-injury requires further exploration. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 1.},

abstract = {The concept of boson realization (or mapping) of Lie algebras appeared first in nuclear physics in 1962 as the idea of expanding bilinear forms in fermion creation and annihilation operators in Taylor series of boson operators, with the object of converting the study of nuclear vibrational motion into a problem of coupled oscillators. The physical situations of interest are quite diverse, depending, for instance, on whether excitations for fixed- or variable-particle number are being studied, on how total angular momentum is decomposed into orbital and spin parts, and on whether isotopic spin and other intrinsic degrees of freedom enter. As a consequence, all of the semisimple algebras other than the exceptional ones have proved to be of interest at one time or another, and all are studied in this review. Though the salient historical facts are presented in the introduction, in the body of the review the progression is (generally) from the simplest algebras to the more complex ones. With a sufficiently broad view of the physics requirements, the mathematical problem is the realization of an arbitrary representation of a Lie algebra in a subspace of a suitably chosen Hilbert space of bosons (Heisenberg-Weyl algebra). Indeed, if one includes the study of odd nuclei, one is forced to consider the mappings to spaces that are direct-product spaces of bosons and (quasi)fermions. Though all the methods that have been used for these problems are reviewed, emphasis is placed on a relatively new algebraic method that has emerged over the past decade. Many of the classic results are rederived, and some new results are obtained for odd systems. The major application of these ideas is to the derivation, starting from the shell model, of the phenomenological models of nuclear collective motion, in particular, the geometric model of Bohr and Mottelson and the more recently developed interacting boson model of Arima and Iachello. A critical discussion of those applications is interwoven with the theoretical developments on which they are based; many other applications are included, some of practical interest, some simply to illustrate the concepts, and some to suggest new lines of inquiry.},

abstract = {Psychological stress has been proposed as a major contributor to the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Acute mental stress can activate the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis, eliciting the release of catecholamines (NE and EPI) resulting in the elevation of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Combined stress (psychological and physical) can exacerbate these cardiovascular responses, which may partially contribute to the elevated risk of CVD and increased proportionate mortality risks experienced by some occupations (e.g., firefighting and law enforcement). Studies have supported the benefits of physical activity on physiological and psychological health, including the cardiovascular response to acute stress. Aerobically trained individuals exhibit lower sympathetic nervous system (e.g., HR) reactivity and enhanced cardiovascular efficiency (e.g., lower vascular reactivity and decreased recovery time) in response to physical and/or psychological stress. In addition, resistance training has been demonstrated to attenuate cardiovascular responses and improve mental health. This review will examine stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity and plausible explanations for how exercise training and physical fitness (aerobic and resistance exercise) can attenuate cardiovascular responses to stress. This enhanced functionality may facilitate a reduction in the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction. Finally, this review will also address the interaction of obesity and physical activity on cardiovascular reactivity and CVD.},

@article{Scutari2013,
abstract = {Objective: Modelling the associations from high-throughput experimental molecular data has provided unprecedented insights into biological pathways and signalling mechanisms. Graphical models and networks have especially proven to be useful abstractions in this regard. Ad hoc thresholds are often used in conjunction with structure learning algorithms to determine significant associations. The present study overcomes this limitation by proposing a statistically motivated approach for identifying significant associations in a network. Methods and materials: A new method that identifies significant associations in graphical models by estimating the threshold minimising the L1 norm between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the observed edge confidences and those of its asymptotic counterpart is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on popular synthetic data sets as well as publicly available experimental molecular data corresponding to gene and protein expression profiles. Results: The improved performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated across the synthetic data sets using sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as performance metrics. The results are also demonstrated across varying sample sizes and three different structure learning algorithms with widely varying assumptions. In all cases, the proposed approach has specificity and accuracy close to 1, while sensitivity increases linearly in the logarithm of the sample size. The estimated threshold systematically outperforms common ad hoc ones in terms of sensitivity while maintaining comparable levels of specificity and accuracy. Networks from experimental data sets are reconstructed accurately with respect to the results from the original papers. Conclusion: Current studies use structure learning algorithms in conjunction with ad hoc thresholds for identifying significant associations in graphical abstractions of biological pathways and signalling mechanisms. Such an ad hoc choice can have pronounced effect on attributing biological significance to the associations in the resulting network and possible downstream analysis. The statistically motivated approach presented in this study has been shown to outperform ad hoc thresholds and is expected to alleviate spurious conclusions of significant associations in such graphical abstractions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@misc{McEwen2000,
abstract = {The primary hormonal mediators of the stress response, glucocorticoids and catecholamines, have both protective and damaging effects on the body. In the short run, they are essential for adaptation, maintenance of homeostasis, and survival (allostasis). Yet, over longer time intervals, they exact a cost (allostatic load) that can accelerate disease processes. The concepts of allostasis and allostatic load center around the brain as interpreter and responder to environmental challenges and as a target of those challenges. In anxiety disorders, depressive illness, hostile and aggressive states, substance abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), allostatic load takes the form of chemical imbalances as well as perturbations in the diurnal rhythm, and, in some cases, atrophy of brain structures. In addition, growing evidence indicates that depressive illness and hostility are both associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other systemic disorders. A major risk factor for these conditions is early childhood experiences of abuse and neglect that increase allostatic load later in life and lead individuals into social isolation, hostility, depression, and conditions like extreme obesity and CVD. Animal models support the notion of lifelong influences of early experience on stress hormone reactivity. Whereas, depression and childhood abuse and neglect tend to be more prevalent in individuals at the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder, cardiovascular and other diseases follow a gradient across the full range of socioeconomic status (SES). An SES gradient is also evident for measures of allostatic load. Wide-ranging SES gradients have also been described for substance abuse and affective and anxiety disorders as a function of education. These aspects are discussed as important, emerging public health issues where the brain plays a key role. Copyright (C) 2000 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.},

abstract = {It is reported that between 65-91{\%} of elite soccer players in Sweden have at least one injury per year. Several studies define different physiological and psychological factors affecting athletic injury-risk. A number of models contain proposals that specify relationships between psychological factors and an increased athletic injury-risk. Examples include Williams and Andersen's stress-injury model and Johnson and Ivarsson's empirical model of injury risk factors which proposes that factors such as trait anxiety and ineffective coping skills are influential. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between (a) personality factors, b) coping variables, and (c) stress and injury risk. Participants were 48 male soccer players from 3 Swedish teams ranging in age from 16 to 36 years (M = 22 years). Participants completed 5 questionnaires: Football Worry Scale, Swedish universities Scales of Personality, Life Events Survey for Collegiate Athletes, Daily Hassle Scale and Brief COPE. Information on injuries was collected by athletic trainers of the teams over 3-months. Results suggest injury was significantly predicted by 4 personality trait predictors: somatic trait anxiety, psychic trait anxiety, stress susceptibility, and trait irritability. Collectively, the predictors self-blame and acceptance could explain 14.6{\%} of injury occurrence. More injuries were reported among players who score high in daily hassles. These results support previous findings. Recommendations are given for both the athletes and the trainers on working to prevent sport injuries. Key pointsA number of psychological factors, such as high stress levels and ineffective coping could increase the injury risk among athletes.The two coping factors, self - blame and acceptance could together explain 14.6 {\%} of injury occurrence.Results of the current study suggest that the factors; somatic trait anxiety, psychic trait anxiety, stress susceptibility and trait irritability could increase injury risk among soccer players.Suggestion for future research is to investigate how daily hassles affects injury risk among soccer players in larger samples and on premiership levels. Moreover, to investigate the effects of a preventive intervention designs for a representative sample of soccer players.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To establish injury rates among a population of elite athletes, to provide normative data for psychological variables hypothesised to be predictive of sport injuries, and to establish relations between measures of mood, perceived life stress, and injury characteristics as a precursor to introducing a psychological intervention to ameliorate the injury problem. METHODS: As part of annual screening procedures, athletes at the Queensland Academy of Sport report medical and psychological status. Data from 845 screenings (433 female and 412 male athletes) were reviewed. Population specific tables of normative data were established for the Brunel mood scale and the perceived stress scale. RESULTS: About 67{\%} of athletes were injured each year, and about 18{\%} were injured at the time of screening. Fifty percent of variance in stress scores could be predicted from mood scores, especially for vigour, depression, and tension. Mood and stress scores collectively had significant utility in predicting injury characteristics. Injury status (current, healed, no injury) was correctly classified with 39{\%} accuracy, and back pain with 48{\%} accuracy. Among a subset of 233 uninjured athletes (116 female and 117 male), five mood dimensions (anger, confusion, fatigue, tension, depression) were significantly related to orthopaedic incidents over the preceding 12 months, with each mood dimension explaining 6-7{\%} of the variance. No sex differences in these relations were found. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support suggestions that psychological measures have utility in predicting athletic injury, although the relatively modest explained variance highlights the need to also include underlying physiological indicators of allostatic load, such as stress hormones, in predictive models.},

The main postural conditions (postural stance, visual condition, balance condition, and test duration) were also analyzed. Moreover, the mechanistic exploration of the postural function often requires implementing disturbing postural conditions by using motor disturbance (mechanical disturbance), sensory stimulation (sensory manipulation), and/or cognitive disturbance (cognitive task associated with maintaining postural balance) protocols.

abstract = {This study had the following two aims: First, to explore the effects of acute resistance exercise (RE, i.e., using exercise machines to contract and stretch muscles) on behavioral and electrophysiological performance when performing a cognitive task involving executive functioning in young male adults; Second, to investigate the potential biochemical mechanisms of such facilitative effects using two neurotrophic factors [i.e., growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)] and the cortisol levels elicited by such an exercise intervention mode with two different exercise intensities. Sixty young male adults were recruited and randomly assigned to a high-intensity (HI) exercise group, moderate-intensity (MI) exercise group, and non-exercise-intervention (NEI) group. Blood samples were taken, and the behavioral and electrophysiological indices were simultaneously measured when individuals performed a Go/No-Go task combined with the Erikson Flanker paradigm at baseline and after either an acute bout of 30 min of moderate- or high-intensity RE or a control period. The results showed that the acute RE could not only benefit the subjects' behavioral (i.e., RTs and accuracy) performance, as found in previous studies, but also increase the P3 amplitude. Although the serum GH and IGF-1 levels were significantly increased via moderate or high intensity RE in both the MI and HI groups, the increased serum levels of neurotrophic factors were significantly decreased about 20 min after exercise. In addition, such changes were not correlated with the changes in cognitive (i.e., behavioral and electrophysiological) performance. In contrast, the serum levels of cortisol in the HI and MI groups were significantly lower after acute RE, and the changes in cortisol levels were significantly associated with the changes in electrophysiological (i.e., P3 amplitude) performance. The findings suggest the beneficial effects of acute RE on executive functioning could be due to changes in arousal, possibly modulated by the serum cortisol levels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Tsai, Wang, Pan, Chen, Huang and Chou.},

abstract = {A theoretical model of stress and athletic injury is presented. The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for the prediction and prevention of stress-related injuries that includes cognitive, physiological, attentional, behavioral, intrapersonal, social, and stress history variables. Development of the model grew from a synthesis of the stress-illness, stress-accident, and stress-injury literatures. The model and its resulting hypotheses offer a frarne-work for many avenues of research into the nature of injury and reduction of injury risk. Other advantages of the model are that it addresses possible mechanisms behind the stress-injury relationship and suggests several specific interventions that may help diminish the likelihood of injury. The model also has the potential of being applied to the investigation of injury and accident occurrence in general. In the U.S. in 1981 over 70,000,000 injuries were incurred that either required medical attention or at least a day of restricted activity. In sports and recreation alone it is conservatively estimated that 3 to 5 million injuries occur each year (Kraus {\&} Conroy, 1984). This alarming information underscores the need for research that delves into the nature of injury and the mechanisms behind its occurrence. The results of such research could be used to identify individuals at high risk of injury and to design intervention programs aimed at reducing the risk of injury. There are myriad factors that may contribute to injury, many of which are primarily physical (e.g., overtraining, equipment failures, poor field conditions, weather, the nature of the sport). Many psychological and social factors may also influence injury occurrence. This paper will address the interconnections of psy-chosocial factors and stress and their impact on injury outcome. First a brief review of the research conducted on psychosocial and stress factors in injury will be presented, followed by a detailed explication of a model for stress and the predic-tion and prevention of athletic injury. Early studies of psychological factors and athletic injury stemmed from clinical or coaching experiences (e.g., Ogilvie, 1966). More recently, better con-Requests for reprints should be sent to},

abstract = {Wide variations in the definitions and methodologies used for studies of injuries in rugby union have created inconsistencies in reported data and made interstudy comparisons of results difficult. The International Rugby Board established a Rugby Injury Consensus Group (RICG) to reach an agreement on the appropriate definitions and methodologies to standardise the recording of injuries and reporting of studies in rugby union. The RICG reviewed the consensus definitions and methodologies previously published for football (soccer) at a meeting in Dublin in order to assess their suitability for and application to rugby union. Following this meeting, iterative draft statements were prepared and circulated to members of the RICG for comment; a follow-up meeting was arranged in Dublin, at which time all definitions and procedures were finalised. At this stage, all authors confirmed their agreement with the consensus statement. The agreed document was presented to and approved by the International Rugby Board Council. Agreement was reached on definitions for injury, recurrent injury, non-fatal catastrophic injury, and training and match exposures, together with criteria for classifying injuries in terms of severity, location, type, diagnosis and causation. The definitions and methodology presented in this consensus statement for rugby union are similar to those proposed for football. Adoption of the proposals presented in this consensus statement should ensure that more consistent and comparable results will be obtained from studies of injuries within rugby union.},

Sample size mainly depends on the expected effect of the risk factor on injury risk, and to detect moderate to strong associations 20-50 injury cases are needed, whereas small to moderate associations would need about 200 injured subjects. Studies published to date on the risk factors for hamstring strains have methodological limitations, and are too small to detect small to moderate associations.},

However, too little or too much stiffness is believed to increase the risk of musculoskeletal injury. Purpose. To provide a current update of the lower extremity stiffness literature as it pertains to both performance and injury. Summary. It appears that increased stiffness is beneficial to performance. As well it appears that there may be an optimal amount of stiffness that allows for injury-free performance. There is some evidence that increased stiffness may be related to bony injuries and decreased stiffness may be associated with soft tissue injuries. Further investigations should evaluate the relationship between stiffness and injury prospectively. Initial reports suggest that stiffness can be modified in response to the external environment or verbal cues. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The influence of psychological factors on injuries in football is poorly documented. The purpose of this 8-month prospective cohort study therefore was to examine whether psychological player characteristics assessed by a self-administered questionnaire represent risk factors for injury. At baseline, female football players (14-16 years) were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire covering player history, previous injuries, perception of success and motivational climate, life stress, anxiety and coping strategies. During the 2005 season, a total of 1430 players were followed up to record injuries. A history of a previous injury [odds ratio (OR)=1.9 (1.4; 2.5), P{\textless}0.001] increased the risk of a new injury to the same region. There were significant differences in disfavor for previously injured compared with non-injured players for ego orientation (P=0.007), perception of a performance climate (P=0.003) and experienced stressful life events (P{\textless}0.001). However, only high life stress (P=0.001) and perception of a mastery climate (P=0.03) were significant risk factors for new injuries. In conclusion, a perceived mastery climate and a high level of life stress were significant predictors for new injuries in a cohort of young female football players.},

Experimental evidence for an associ- ation between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of either increased sympathetic or reduced vagal activity has encouraged the development of quantitative markers of autonomic activity. Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising such markers. The apparently easy derivation of this measure has popularized its use. As many commercial devices now provide automated measurement of HRV, the cardiologist has been pro- vided with a seemingly simple tool for both research and clinical studies[5]. However, the significance and meaning of the many different measures of HRV are more complex than generally appreciated and there is a potential for incorrect conclusions and for excessive or unfounded extrapolations.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Sport-related concussions are associated with a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances that are highly variable across individuals. Much remains unknown about the effects of sport concussion, and changes in markers of psychological and physiological stress over the recovery timeline. OBJECTIVE:: To examine psychological (mood, stress, sleep quality, and symptoms) and physiological (heart rate variability and salivary cortisol) measures in concussed athletes over clinical recovery milestones. SETTING:: University athletic program, sport medicine clinic, Canada. PARTICIPANTS:: A sample of 52 interuniversity athletes (32 male and 20 female), 26 with concussion and 26 healthy controls. DESIGN:: Case-control repeated measures study at 3 time points of the clinical recovery process. Measures were administered to a matched control sample of uninjured athletes as well. MAIN MEASURES:: Physiological measures were heart rate variability and salivary cortisol; psychological measures were mood, perceived stress, and quality of sleep. RESULTS:: Psychological measures were significantly worse for concussed athletes relative to controls at the symptomatic phase (acute injury), but significantly better at return-to-play (RTP). Multivariate analysis of heart rate variability identified main effects of sex and concussion, with reduced high-frequency heart rate variability for females and concussed athletes extending into the post-RTP phase. An interaction effect was also observed, showing the cardiac response of female athletes was more sensitive to concussion compared with males. Conversely, male athletes showed greater suppression of low-frequency heart rate variability associated with mood disturbances. CONCLUSION:: This integrated study of psychological and physiological markers in concussed athletes confirmed the resolution of mood disturbances, symptoms, and sleep quality by RTP, but identified autonomic nervous system disturbances, as measured by depressed heart rate variability beyond RTP.

This study aimed to examine the differences in balance strategy and balance performance between amateur rugby players and non-players, and to explore training- and injury-related factors that may affect rugby players' balance outcomes. Design Cross-sectional and exploratory study. Methods Forty-five amateur rugby players and 41 healthy active individuals participated in the study. Balance performance and balance strategies were assessed using the sensory organization test (SOT) of the Smart Equitest computerized dynamic posturography machine. Rugby training history and injury history were solicited from the participants. Results The SOT strategy scores were 1.99–54.90{\%} lower in the rugby group than in the control group (p {\textless} 0.05), and the equilibrium scores were 1.06–14.29{\%} lower in the rugby group than in the control group (p {\textless} 0.05). After accounting for age, sex and body mass index, only length of rugby training (in years) was independently associated with the SOT condition 6 strategy score, explaining 15.7{\%} of its variance (p = 0.006). There was no association between SOT condition 6 strategy/equilibrium scores and injury history among the rugby players (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusions Amateur rugby players demonstrated inferior balance strategy and balance performance compared to their non-training counterparts. Their suboptimal balance strategy was associated with insufficient training experience but not with history of injury.},

abstract = {Background: Based on combined analysis of clinical assessment of parkinsonian rigidity (constant resistance force generated during passive movement in a joint), electromyography and/or dynamometry many studies showed objectively that anti-parkinsonian medication decreases the rigidity in Parkinson's disease (PD). Rigidity-related changes in resting muscle stiffness (changed muscle's mechanical property related to its structural changes and changed neural drive) in PD patients have been revealed by myometry, a simple, sensitive, and reliable method for measuring mechanical properties in human soft tissues. However, an application of myometry in estimation of medication effects on the PD rigidity-related muscle stiffness has not been reported yet. Therefore, our study aimed to assess medication-induced changes in resting muscle stiffness in PD patients using myometry. Methods: We measured resting muscle stiffness by myometry and recorded a surface electromyogram of relaxed biceps brachii, brachioradialis and triceps brachii muscles in ten patients with PD (age: 51-80 years; Hoehn and Yahr stage: 2.5-4) during medication on-phase (when subjects felt best comfort and fitness after medication: Levodopa, Piribedil, Ropinirol) and medication off-phase (12 h after withdrawal of the medication). Findings: Our patients had significantly lower myometric stiffness and electromyogram amplitude in all tested muscles, and also lower clinical rigidity scores during the medication on-phase compared with the medication off-phase. Interpretation: Myometry revealed that anti-parkinsonian medication decreases not only rigidity in PD, but also rigidity-related stiffness in resting skeletal muscles in PD patients. These findings show that myometry can enrich neurological practice, by allowing objective and reliable assessment of parkinsonian rigidity treatment effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In order to express the precision, or repeatability, of immunoassay test results, researchers in the social and behavioral sciences typically report two measures of the Coefficient of Variability (CV) in their publications: the Inter-Assay CV and the Intra-Assay CV. The CV is a dimensionless number defined as the standard deviation of a set of measurements divided by the mean of the set. Since the usage of the term intra-assay CV may vary somewhat between fields of study, some clarification of terminology and methods is in order. In larger studies with many samples to be tested, it is necessary that samples be run on multiple assay plates. Each plate is run with its own calibrators for the standard curve, and saliva controls with known concentrations of the analyte–usually a high and a low value–are also included on each plate. The inter-assay CV is an expression of plate-to-plate consistency that is calculated from the mean values for the high and low controls on each plate, as illustrated in Example 1 below (taken from internal Salimetrics data). Most studies measure each sample in duplicate for each analyte. The degree to which the duplicate results differ can be expressed by calculating the standard deviation of the two results and converting it to the CV. Testing each sample with greater numbers of replicates would produce statistically better results for the standard deviation and calculation of the CV, but this practice would be prohibitively expensive for large studies. The intra-assay CV reported in these studies is an average value calculated from the individual CVs for all of the duplicates, even if the total number of samples requires the use of multiple assay plates. (1) An illustration of the calculation of the intra-assay CV from 40 samples (using internal Salimetrics data) is provided in Example 2.},

abstract = {There is a critical need for data-mining methods that can identify SNPs that predict among individual variation in a phenotype of interest and reverse-engineer the biological network of relationships between SNPs, phenotypes, and other factors. This problem is both challenging and important in light of the large number of SNPs in many genes of interest and across the human genome. A potentially fruitful form of exploratory data analysis is the Bayesian or Belief network. A Bayesian or Belief network provides an analytic approach for identifying robust predictors of among-individual variation in a disease endpoints or risk factor levels. We have applied Belief networks to SNP variation in the human APOE gene and plasma apolipoprotein E levels from two samples: 702 African-Americans from Jackson, MS, and 854 non-Hispanic whites from Rochester, MN. Twenty variable sites in the APOE gene were genotyped in both samples. In Jackson, MS, SNPs 4036 and 4075 were identified to influence plasma apoE levels. In Rochester, MN, SNPs 3937 and 4075 were identified to influence plasma apoE levels. All three SNPs had been previously implicated in affecting measures of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Like all data-mining methods, Belief networks are meant to complement traditional hypothesis-driven methods of data analysis. These results document the utility of a Belief network approach for mining large scale genotype-phenotype association data.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess the reliability of a mobile contact mat in measuring a range of stretch-shortening cycle parameters in young adolescents. Additionally, vertical leg stiffness using contact mat data was validated against a criterion method using force-time data. The reliability study involved 18 youths completing a habituation and three separate test sessions, while 20 youths completed a single test session for the validity study. Participants completed three trials of a squat jump, countermovement jump, and maximal hopping test and a single trial of repeated sub-maximal hopping at 2.0 Hz and 2.5 Hz. All tests were performed on the contact mat. Reliability statistics included repeated-measures analysis of variance, intraclass correlation coefficient, and coefficient of variation (CV), while the correlation coefficient (r) and typical error of estimate (TEE) were reported for the validity study. Squat jump height was the most reliable measure (CV = 8.64{\%}), while leg stiffness during sub-maximal hopping, and reactive strength index produced moderate reliability (CV = 10.17-13.93{\%} and 13.98{\%} respectively). Measures of leg stiffness obtained from contact mat data during sub-maximal hopping were in agreement with the criterion measure (r = 0.92-0.95; TEE = 6.5-7.5{\%}), but not during maximal hopping (r = 0.59; TEE = 41.9{\%}). The contact mat was deemed a valid tool for measuring stretch-shortening cycle ability in sub-maximal but not maximal hopping. Although reliability of performance was generally moderate, the tests offer a replicable assessment method for use with paediatric populations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {Objectives There have been recent calls for the application of the complex systems approach in sports injury research. However, beyond theoretical description and static models of complexity, little progress has been made towards formalising this approach in way that is practical to sports injury scientists and clinicians. Therefore, our objective was to use a computational modelling method and develop a dynamic simulation in sports injury research.Methods Agent-based modelling (ABM) was used to model the occurrence of sports injury in a synthetic athlete population. The ABM was developed based on sports injury causal frameworks and was applied in the context of distance running-related injury (RRI). Using the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR), we simulated the dynamic relationship between changes in weekly running distance and RRI through the manipulation of various ‘athlete management tools'.Results The findings confirmed that building weekly running distances over time, even within the reported ACWR ‘sweet spot', will eventually result in RRI as athletes reach and surpass their individual physical workload limits. Introducing training-related error into the simulation and the modelling of a ‘hard ceiling' dynamic resulted in a higher RRI incidence proportion across the population at higher absolute workloads.Conclusions The presented simulation offers a practical starting point to further apply more sophisticated computational models that can account for the complex nature of sports injury aetiology. Alongside traditional forms of scientific inquiry, the use of ABM and other simulation-based techniques could be considered as a complementary and alternative methodological approach in sports injury research.},

abstract = {There is considerable evidence to support a number of biomechanical risk factors associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. This paper aims to review these biomechanical risk factors and highlight future directions relating to them. Current perspectives investigating trunk position and relationships between strength, muscle activity and biomechanics during landing/cutting highlight the importance of increasing hamstring muscle force during dynamic movements through altering strength, muscle activity, muscle length and contraction velocity. In particular, increased trunk flexion during landing/cutting and greater hamstring strength are likely to increase hamstring muscle force during landing and cutting which have been associated with reduced ACL injury risk. Decision making has also been shown to influence landing biomechanics and should be considered when designing tasks to assess landing/cutting biomechanics. Coaches should therefore promote hamstring strength training and active trunk flexion during landing and cutting in an attempt to reduce ACL injury risk.},

abstract = {Five male triathletes of the Estonian national junior team were observed during a seven-week competition period. The Myoton-2 equipment was used to describe the viscoelastic parameters of the skeletal muscles. The frequency of damped mechanical oscillation of the muscle tissue (Hz - indicating the tension in the muscle), logarithmic decrement of the oscillations (Theta - indicating the elasticity of the muscle) and stiffness (N m(-1)) of the muscle tissue were registered bilaterally in eight muscles in both the relaxed and the contracted states: BB - biceps brachii (caput longum); TB - triceps brachii (caput longum); BF - biceps femoris (caput longum); RF - rectus femoris; TA - tibialis anterior; GC - gastrocnemius (caput mediale); LD - latissimus dorsi; PM - pectoralis major (pars sternocostalis). A portable massage table was used for the subject to rest on during the measuring. For the measurement of the anterior muscles, the subject lay supine; for the posterior muscles the prone position was used. The (isometric) contraction was standardized simply by the same measuring position of the limb-the subject raised his arm or leg to an angle of 45 degrees from the horizontal level, using a 2.3 kg dumb-bell as an additional weight for the upper limb. The tarsal dorsiflexion and plantarflexion was performed against a fixed table to contract the crural muscles. The elasticity of the skeletal muscle is higher for the contracted state with respect to the relaxed one (p {\textless} 0.0001) and is described by decline of the value of logarithmic decrement, the stiffness and the tension in the muscle increases (p {\textless} 0.0001 for both parameters). The measured skeletal muscles differ significantly (p {\textless} 0.0018) by the viscoelastic properties in the relaxed state. In the relaxed state, TA was the most elastic (mean +/- SD; Theta-0.74 +/- 0.13), stiff (mean +/- SD; 346.68 +/- 60.34 N m(-1)) and tense muscle (mean +/- SD; 18.72 +/- 1.55 Hz). In the contracted state, the elasticity of TA did not change (0.76 +/- 0.14) while the stiffness and the tension in this muscle rose significantly (93{\%} and 38{\%}, accordingly). Personal differences (p {\textless} 0.005) exist if pooled data from the muscles are compared between the subjects.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the metric properties of a myotonometer. Design: Metric study. Setting: Three medical centers. Participants: Stroke patients (N=67). Intervention: Upper-extremity rehabilitation programs. Main Outcome Measures: The tone, elasticity, and stiffness of relaxed extensor digitorum, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris were measured using the myotonometer. Fifty-eight patients completed the myotonometer measures twice at pretreatment. The myotonometric measurement and the criteria measures, including hand strength (grip, lateral pinch, and palmar pinch strength) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) were administered at pretreatment and posttreatment. Results: The myotonometer showed high test-retest reliability for muscle properties in 3 muscles. Significant correlations existed between the tone and stiffness of the 3 muscles and palmar pinch strength, between those of the flexor carpi muscles and lateral pinch strength, and between those of the flexor carpi radialis and the ARAT at posttreatment. The posttreatment elasticity of the 2 flexor carpi muscles was significantly correlated with grip strength. The pretreatment elasticity of the flexor carpi ulnaris was significantly correlated with posttreatment grip strength, and the pretreatment muscle tone and stiffness of the flexor carpi radialis were significantly correlated with palmar pinch strength and the ARAT. The responsiveness of the extensor digitorum was higher than that of the flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris. Muscle stiffness was more responsive than tone and elasticity in 3 muscles. Conclusions: Myotonometry can be a reliable, valid, and responsive outcome measure for assessing muscle properties after stroke rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {The history of research into psychosocial antecedents of sport injuries reaches back 35 years. In the more than 3 decades of research into predictors of athletic injury, myriad articles have appeared in the literature, ranging from early psychodynamic formulations of injury to the now more established models currently guiding the field. There is little doubt about the significance of psychosocial variables' (e.g., stress, social support, coping) influences on injury risk and injury outcome. Since the last edition of this Handbook, relatively few studies have been conducted on the psychosocial antecedents of sport injury, probably due, in part, to how well those variables have been established in the literature. Another factor for the limited recent research may be that doing such studies has procedural and logistic difficulties (e.g., large numbers needed, record keeping). The long-term goal of injury antecedent research was to develop interventions aimed at modifying the identified psychosocial risk factors (e.g., reducing stress, increasing coping) to decrease injury occurrence and improve the quality of life and sporting experiences of athletes. Currently, intervention research is the cutting edge of sport injury inquiry and perhaps the most exciting aspect of this evolving field of sport science. Limited research into prevention has been conducted so far, but what we have holds substantial promise. We review the current injury prediction and prevention research as well as summarize the findings from earlier research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)},

abstract = {Study Design Retrospective cohort. Background Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) performance differs by sport in healthy collegiate athletes, and lower extremity injury rates also vary by sport, sex, and athletic exposure. The relationship between SEBT performance and injury risk has not been evaluated with consideration of these additional variables, which may be necessary to fully describe the relationship between SEBT performance and injury risk. Objectives To assess the association between preseason SEBT performance and noncontact injury occurrence to the knee or ankle in Division I collegiate athletes when controlling for sport, sex, and athletic exposure. Methods Star Excursion Balance Test performance, starting status, and injury status were reviewed retrospectively in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate athletes from a single institution. A total of 147 athletes were healthy at the time of preseason SEBT testing and either remained healthy (n = 118) or sustained a noncontact injury to the knee or ankle (n = 29) during their sport's subsequent competitive season. Side-to-side asymmetries were calculated in each direction as the absolute difference in reach distance between limbs. Star Excursion Balance Test reach distances and asymmetries were compared between groups using multivariable regression, controlling for sport, sex, and athletic exposure (starter, nonstarter). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity for significant models. Results When controlling for sport, sex, and athletic exposure, SEBT side-to-side asymmetry in the anterior direction, expressed as an absolute or normalized to limb length, discriminated between injured and noninjured athletes (area under the curve greater than 0.82). Conclusion Assessing side-to-side reach asymmetry in the anterior direction of the SEBT may assist in identifying collegiate athletes who are at risk for sustaining noncontact injuries to the knee or ankle.

abstract = {Research suggests that experiencing a moderate number of adverse life events can benefit future stress responses. This study explored the relationship between adverse life (ie, non-sport) events and cardiovascular responses to, and performance during, a pressurized sporting task. One hundred participants (64 men, 36 women; Mage =21.94 years, SDage =4.98) reported the number of adverse life events (eg, serious accident or injury) they had encountered before completing a pressurized dart-throwing task during which performance was recorded. Before the task, participants' demand and resource evaluations and cardiovascular reactivity were assessed. Adverse life events did not impact demand and resource evaluations. However, participants who reported 4-7 adverse life events displayed cardiovascular responses more reflective of a challenge state (relatively lower total peripheral resistance and/or higher cardiac output) compared to those who reported a lower ({\textless}4) or higher ({\textgreater}7) number of events. Furthermore, participants who reported 3-13 adverse life events outperformed those who reported a lower ({\textless}3) or higher ({\textgreater}13) number of events. Supplementary analyses suggested that this relationship might be due to a small number of extreme values. However, after outlier analyses, a significant linear relationship remained suggesting that a higher number of adverse life events facilitated performance. The results suggest that experiencing a moderate to high number of adverse life events might have beneficial effects on subsequent cardiovascular responses and performance under pressure. Practitioners should therefore consider prior brushes with adversity when identifying athletes who are likely to excel during stressful competition.},

abstract = {Following the publication of the Task Force document on heart rate variability (HRV) in 1996, a number of articles have been published to describe new HRV methodologies and their application in different physiological and clinical studies. This document presents a critical review of the new methods. A particular attention has been paid to methodologies that have not been reported in the 1996 standardization document but have been more recently tested in sufficiently sized populations. The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning. Multidisciplinary dialogue and specialized courses in the combination of clinical cardiology and complex signal processing methods seem warranted for further advances in studies of cardiac oscillations and in the understanding normal and abnormal cardiac control processes.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to examine the trapezius muscle tone by measuring simultaneously using Myoton-2 myometer i.e., the natural oscillation frequency, stiffness and the elasticity of the trapezius muscle. With this method, the mechanical response of the muscle, to a short applied mechanical impulse, is registered by an acceleration probe. From the acquired damped natural oscillation waveform, the frequency (Hz), the stiffness (N/m) and the logarithmic decrement of damping (characterizing tissue's elasticity) are calculated, quantifying the functional state of the muscle. The trapezius muscle on both sides of the body was tested in twenty adult women by two investigators using the Myoton-2 myometer. During the measurements, the subjects were in a relaxed sitting position. The Bland and Altman graphical test, comparing the differences of the measurements of two investigators, was used for assessing the inter-observer repeatability. The registered values for the trapezius muscle tension, stiffness and e...},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to concurrently assess musculo-articular stiffness (MAS) and muscle stiffness (MS) of the knee extensors in younger and older individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Fourteen young (22.1 ± 3.0 years old) and 12 older (65.4 ± 5.7 years old) men were tested for maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), rate of torque development (RTD), muscle thickness, MAS, and MS of knee extensors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: MVC, RTD, and muscle thickness were higher in the younger group (288.6 vs. 194.3 Nm, 1319.5 vs. 787.0 Nm s(-1), 23.1 vs. 17.7 mm, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05). MAS normalized to the load supported (30{\%} of MVC) was not different between groups (87.9 vs. 88.5 Nm(-1) kg(-1)), whereas the older group exhibited a higher level of normalized MS (23.2 vs. 18.6 Nm(-1) kg(-1), P {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Determinants of MS have been highlighted along with their role in elevated MS. The unaltered level of MAS, which is functionally important in an aging population, might be achieved through a decrease in tendon stiffness.},

abstract = {In this study, we measured changes in state anxiety, visual perception and reaction time during stress among 196 collegiate athletes participating in 10 sports. The athletes also completed measures of life events and social support at the beginning of their seasons. Measures of life events stress, social support, perceptual changes and changes in reaction time during stress were used as predictors of the number of injuries. For the entire sample, the only significant predictor of injury was negative life events stress (R = 0.45, P {\textless} 0.001). Following the suggestions of Smith et al., simple correlations were performed for those with least social support (bottom 33{\%}, n = 65). Among this group, those individuals with more negative life events and greater peripheral narrowing during stress incurred more injuries than those with the opposite profile. Our findings are in line with the model of Andersen and Williams, in that those individuals who were low in a variable that buffers stress responsivity (i.e. social support), their negative life events and peripheral narrowing under stress (large and medium effect sizes, respectively) were substantially related to their number of injuries.},

abstract = {In this study, we compared the reliability of short-term resting heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) and postexercise parasympathetic reactivation (i.e., HR recovery (HRR) and HRV) indices following either submaximal or supramaximal exercise. On 4 different occasions, beat-to-beat HR was recorded in 15 healthy males (21.5 ± 1.4 yr) during 5 min of seated rest, followed by submaximal (Sub) and supramaximal (Supra) exercise bouts; both exercise bouts were followed by 5 min of seated recovery. Reliability of all HR-derived indices was assessed by the typical error of measurement expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV,{\%}). CV for HRV indices ranged from 4 to 17{\%}, 7 to 27{\%} and 41 to 82{\%} for time domain, spectral and ratio indices, respectively. The CV for HRR ranged from 15 to 32{\%}. Spectral CVs for HRV were lower at rest compared with Supra (e.g., natural logarithm of the high frequency range (LnHF); 12.6 vs. 26.2{\%}; P=0.02). HRR reliability was not different between Sub and Supra (25 vs. 14{\%}; P=0.10). The present study found discrepancy in the CVs of vagal-related heart rate indices; a finding that should be appreciated when assessing changes in these variables. Further, Supra exercise was shown to worsen the reliability of HRV-spectral indices.},
